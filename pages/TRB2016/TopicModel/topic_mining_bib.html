  abstract = {Abstract The essential work of feature-specific opinion mining is centered on the product features. Previous related research work has often taken into account explicit features but ignored implicit features, However, implicit feature identification, which can help us better understand the reviews, is an essential aspect of feature-specific opinion mining. This paper is mainly centered on implicit feature identification in Chinese product reviews. We think that based on the explicit synonymous feature group and the sentences which contain explicit features, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers can be established to classify the non-explicit sentences. Nevertheless, instead of simply using traditional feature selection methods, we believe an explicit topic model in which each topic is pre-defined could perform better. In this paper, we first extend a popular topic modeling method, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to construct an explicit topic model. Then some types of prior knowledge, such as: must-links, cannot-links and relevance-based prior knowledge, are extracted and incorporated into the explicit topic model automatically. Experiments show that the explicit topic model, which incorporates pre-existing knowledge, outperforms traditional feature selection methods and other existing methods by a large margin and the identification task can be completed better. }

  abstract = {AbstractContext Mining software repositories has emerged as a research direction over the past decade, achieving substantial success in both research and practice to support various software maintenance tasks. Software repositories include bug repository, communication archives, source control repository, etc. When using these repositories to support software maintenance, inclusion of irrelevant information in each repository can lead to decreased effectiveness or even wrong results. Objective This article aims at selecting the relevant information from each of the repositories to improve effectiveness of software maintenance tasks. Method For a maintenance task at hand, maintainers need to implement the maintenance request on the current system. In this article, we propose an approach, MSR4SM, to extract the relevant information from each software repository based on the maintenance request and the current system. That is, if the information in a software repository is relevant to either the maintenance request or the current system, this information should be included to perform the current maintenance task. \{MSR4SM\} uses the topic model to extract the topics from these software repositories. Then, relevant information in each software repository is extracted based on the topics. Results \{MSR4SM\} is evaluated for two software maintenance tasks, feature location and change impact analysis, which are based on four subject systems, namely jEdit, ArgoUML, Rhino and KOffice. The empirical results show that the effectiveness of traditional software repositories based maintenance tasks can be greatly improved by MSR4SM. Conclusions There is a lot of irrelevant information in software repositories. Before we use them to implement a maintenance task at hand, we need to preprocess them. Then, the effectiveness of the software maintenance tasks can be improved. }

This article concentrates on the mining of readers’ emotions evoked by social media materials. Compared to the classical sentiment analysis from writers’ perspective, sentiment analysis of readers is sometimes more meaningful in social media. We propose two sentiment topic models to associate latent topics with evoked emotions of readers. The first model which is an extension of the existing Supervised Topic Model, generates a set of topics from words firstly, followed by sampling emotions from each topic. The second model generates topics from social emotions directly. Both models can be applied to social emotion classification and generate social emotion lexicons. Evaluation on social emotion classification verifies the effectiveness of the proposed models. The generated social emotion lexicon samples further show that our models can discover meaningful latent topics exhibiting emotion focus. }

I describe a series of statistical methods for handling a large corpus of Twitter messages that might otherwise be impractical to analyze. A key finding is that the transformative effect of Twitter in academia is to easily enable the spontaneous formation of information-sharing communities bound by an interest in an event or topic. }

The proposed method treats each time series as a text document, and extracts a set of local patterns from the sequence as words by sliding a short temporal window along the sequence. Motivated by the success of latent topic models in text document analysis, latent topic models are extended to find the underlying structure of time series in an unsupervised manner. The clusters or categories of unlabeled time series are automatically discovered by the latent topic models using bag-of-patterns representation. The proposed method was experimentally validated using two sets of time series data extracted from a public Electrocardiography (ECG) database through comparison with the baseline k-means and the Normalized Cuts approaches. In addition, the impact of the bag-of-patterns' parameters was investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised method not only outperforms the baseline k-means and the Normalized Cuts in learning semantic categories of the unlabeled time series, but also is relatively stable with respect to the bag-of-patterns' parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to explore latent topic models for unsupervised mining of time series data. }

In this paper, we present a tag-topic model for blog mining, which is based on the Author-Topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The tag-topic model determines the most likely tags and words for a given topic in a collection of blog posts. The model has been successfully implemented and evaluated on real-world blog data. }

Since hierarchical structure is characteristics of topics, it is preferential for a topic extraction algorithm to output the topics description with this kind of structure. However, the hierarchical topic structure that is extracted by most of the current topic analysis algorithms cannot provide a meaningful description for all subtopics in the hierarchical tree. Here, we propose a new hierarchical topic extraction algorithm based on topic grain computation. By considering the distribution of word document frequency as a mixture Gaussian, an EM-like algorithm is employed to achieve the best number of mixture components, and the mean value of each component. Then topic grain is defined based on the mixture Gaussian parameters, and feature words are selected for the grain. A clustering algorithm is employed to the converted text set based on the feature words. After repeatedly applying the clustering algorithm to different converted text set, a multi-grain hierarchical topic structure with different subtopic feature words description is extracted. Experiments on two real world datasets which are collected from a news website show that the proposed algorithm can generate more meaningful multi-grain topic structure, by comparing with the current hierarchical topic clustering algorithms. }

A general criteria based on Zipf fitness quantity computation is proposed to determine whether a topic description is well-form or not. Based on the quantity definition, the popular Dirichlet prior on multinomial parameters is found that it cannot always produce well-form topic descriptions. Hence, topics modeling based on \{LDA\} with selective Zipf documents as training dataset is proposed to improve the quality in generation of topics description. Experiments on two standard text corpuses, i.e. \{AP\} dataset and Reuters-21578, show that the modeling method based on selective Zipf distribution can achieve better perplexity, which means better ability in predicting topics. While a test of topics extraction on a collection of news documents about recent financial crisis shows that the description key words in topics are more meaningful and reasonable than that of tradition topic mining method. }

In this paper, we propose two models to detect communities by considering both topic and dynamic features. First, the Community Topic Model (CTM) can identify communities sharing similar topics. Second, the Dynamic \{CTM\} (DCTM) can capture the dynamic features of communities and topics based on the Bernoulli distribution that leverages the temporal continuity between consecutive timestamps. Both models were tested on two datasets: ArnetMiner and Twitter. Experiments show that communities with similar topics can be detected and the co-evolution of communities and topics can be observed by these two models, which allow us to better understand the dynamic features of social networks and make improved personalized recommendations. }

Several approaches have been devised to conquer these deficiencies. In this work, we propose a novel \{SOM\} learning algorithm which incorporates several text mining techniques in expanding the map both laterally and hierarchically. On training a set of text documents, the proposed algorithm will first cluster them using classical \{SOM\} algorithm. We then identify the topics of each cluster. These topics are then used to evaluate the criteria on expanding the map. The major characteristic of the proposed approach is to combine the learning process with text mining process and makes it suitable for automatic organization of text documents. We applied the algorithm on the Reuters-21578 dataset in text clustering and categorization tasks. Our method outperforms two comparing models in hierarchy quality according to users’ evaluation. It also receives better F1-scores than two other models in text categorization task. }

  abstract = {Abstract Frequent subtree mining is a major research topic in knowledge discovery from tree-structured data, whose importance is witnessed by the pervasiveness of such data in several domains. In this paper, we present a novel approach to discover all the frequent ordered subtrees in a tree-structured database. A key aspect is that the structural aspects of the input tree instances are extracted to generate a transactional format that enables the application of standard itemset mining techniques. In this way, the expensive process of subtree enumeration is avoided, while subtrees can be reconstructed in a post-processing stage. As a result, more structurally complex tree data can be handled and much lower support thresholds can be used. In addition to discovering traditional subtrees, this is the first approach to frequent subtree mining that can discover position-constrained subtrees. Each node in the position-constrained subtree is annotated with its exact occurrence and level of embedding in the original database tree. Also, disconnected subtree associations can be represented via virtual connecting nodes. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the expected advantages of our approach over competing methods in terms of efficiency, mining capabilities, and informativeness of the extracted patterns. }

In recent years, high utility itemset (HUI) has emerged as a hot topic in this field. In real applications, the bottleneck of \{HUI\} mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability, due to the huge number of itemsets generated by the mining process. Because the downward closure property of itemsets no longer holds for HUIs, the compression or summarization methods for frequent itemsets are not available. With this in mind, considering coverage and diversity, we introduce a novel well-founded approach, called SUIT-miner, for succinctly summarizing \{HUIs\} with a small collection of itemsets. First, we define the condition under which an itemset can cover another itemset. Then, a greedy algorithm is presented to find the least itemsets to cover all of HUIs, in order to ensure diversity. For enhancing the efficiency, the greedy algorithm employs some pruning strategies. To evaluate the performance of SUIT-miner, we conduct extensive experiments on real datasets. The experimental results show that SUIT-miner is effective and efficient. }

Accordingly, the resources and techniques to help tackle the problem are many, and most of the latest work fuses them at some stage of the process. However, this combination is usually executed without following any defined guidelines and overlooking the possibility of replicating and improving it, hence the need for a deeper understanding of the fusion process becomes apparent. Information Fusion is the field charged with researching efficient methods for transforming information from different sources into a single coherent representation, and therefore can be used to guide fusion processes in Opinion Mining. In this paper we present a survey on Information Fusion applied to Opinion Mining. We first define Opinion Mining and describe its most fundamental aspects, later explain Information Fusion and finally review several Opinion Mining studies that rely at some point on the fusion of information. }

Two theorems for fast determining \{FCPs\} based on the N-list structure are proposed. The N-list structure provides a much more compact representation compared to previously proposed vertical structures, reducing the memory usage and mining time required for mining FCPs. The experimental results show that \{NAFCP\} outperforms previous algorithms in terms of runtime and memory usage in most cases. }

Data mining is a technique that has been widely used to extract hidden information from such data. Data mining is mainly composed of association rules mining, sequent pattern mining, classification and clustering. Association rules mining has attracted significant attention and been successfully applied to various fields. Although the past studies can effectively discover frequent patterns to deduce association rules, execution efficiency is still a critical problem. To speed up execution, many methods using parallel and distributed computing technology have been proposed in recent years. Most of the past studies focused on parallelizing the workload in a high end machine or in distributed computing environments like grid or cloud computing systems; however, very few of them discuss how to efficiently determine the appropriate number of computing nodes, considering execution efficiency and load balancing. An intuition is that execution speed is proportional to the number of computing nodes—that is, more the number of computing nodes, faster is the execution speed. However, this is incorrect for such algorithms because of the inherently algorithmic design. Allocating too many computing nodes can lead to high execution time. In addition to the execution inefficiency, inappropriate resource allocation is a waste of computing power and network bandwidth. At the same time, load cannot be effectively distributed if there are too few nodes allocated. In this paper, we propose a fast, load balancing and resource efficient algorithm named FLR-Mining for discovering frequent patterns in distributed computing systems. FLR-Mining is capable of determining the appropriate number of computing nodes automatically and achieving better load balancing as compared with existing methods. Through empirical evaluation, FLR-Mining is shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of execution efficiency and load balancing. }

Information recorded by systems during the operation of these processes provides an angle for operational process analysis, commonly referred to as process mining. In this work, we establish a queueing perspective in process mining to address the online delay prediction problem, which refers to the time that the execution of an activity for a running instance of a service process is delayed due to queueing effects. We present predictors that treat queues as first-class citizens and either enhance existing regression-based techniques for process mining or are directly grounded in queueing theory. In particular, our predictors target multi-class service processes, in which requests are classified by a type that influences their processing. Further, we introduce queue mining techniques that derive the predictors from event logs recorded by an information system during process execution. Our evaluation based on large real-world datasets, from the telecommunications and financial sectors, shows that our techniques yield accurate online predictions of case delay and drastically improve over predictors neglecting the queueing perspective. }

However, the correlations between the activities and their frequent patterns have never been directly addressed by traditional activity recognition techniques. As a result, activities that trigger the same set of sensors are difficult to differentiate, even though they present different patterns such as different frequencies of the sensor events. In this paper, we propose an efficient association rule mining technique to find the association rules between the activities and their frequent patterns, and build an activity classifier based on these association rules. We also address the classification of overlapped activities by incorporating the global and local weight of the patterns. The experiment results using publicly available dataset demonstrate that our method is able to achieve better performance than traditional recognition methods such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayesian and HMM. Comparison studies show that the proposed association rule mining method is efficient, and we can further improve the activity recognition accuracy by considering global and local weight of frequent patterns of activities. }

In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic model framework based on the non-parametric hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) topic model, called non-parametric joint sentiment topic mixture model (NJST), which adds a sentiment level to the \{HDP\} topic model and detects sentiment and topics simultaneously from reviews. Then considered the dynamic nature of social media data, we propose dynamic \{NJST\} (dNJST) which adds time decay dependencies of historical epochs to the current epochs. Compared with the existing sentiment topic mixture models which are based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the biggest difference of \{NJST\} and dNJST is that they can determine topic number automatically. We implement \{NJST\} and dNJST with online variational inference algorithms, and incorporate the sentiment priors of words into \{NJST\} and dNJST with HowNet lexicon. The experiment results in some Chinese social media dataset show that dNJST can effectively detect and track dynamic sentiment and topics. }

Image score calculated from the saliency map is also investigated to optimize a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

  abstract = {Abstract The recent developments in cellular networks, along with the increase in services, users and the demand of high quality have raised the Operational Expenditure (OPEX). Self-Organizing Networks (SON) are the solution to reduce these costs. Within SON, self-healing is the functionality that aims to automatically solve problems in the radio access network, at the same time reducing the downtime and the impact on the user experience. Self-healing comprises four main functions: fault detection, root cause analysis, fault compensation and recovery. To perform the root cause analysis (also known as diagnosis), Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) are commonly used, such as fuzzy logic. In this paper, a novel method for extracting the Knowledge Base for a \{KBS\} from solved troubleshooting cases is proposed. This method is based on data mining techniques as opposed to the manual techniques currently used. The data mining problem of extracting knowledge out of \{LTE\} troubleshooting information can be considered a Big Data problem. Therefore, the proposed method has been designed so it can be easily scaled up to process a large volume of data with relatively low resources, as opposed to other existing algorithms. Tests show the feasibility and good results obtained by the diagnosis system created by the proposed methodology in \{LTE\} networks. }

These may concern particular technologies, the competitive position of particular organizations, or national/regional shifts. For decades, the \{US\} has been the world leader in biomedical technologies, with attendant implications for organizational priorities in terms of R&amp;D location and market targeting. Recent years have seen a tremendous acceleration in Asian research in most domains, including biomedical, particularly visible in China. This paper investigates comparative patterns between the \{US\} and China in a promising emerging area of biotechnology — Nano-Enhanced Drug Delivery. It then explores indicators of, and implications for, future transitions at the national level — an approach we label “Forecasting Innovation Pathways.” }

These new technology-based \{BMs\} have played an important role in knowledge flow as they became a patentable subject matter. However, there are not many studies on knowledge flow through the technology-based \{BMs\} or \{BM\} patents in spite of its importance. As an attempt to provide a deeper understanding of technology-based \{BMs\} with regard to knowledge flow, this paper explores knowledge flows driven by the technology-based \{BMs\} through investigating both cited and citing patents. In order to explore the knowledge flows, this paper proposes an algorithm that utilizes both the citation and textual information of \{BM\} patents. In addition to citation information, text data in patent documents are used to measure the degree of knowledge flow in a more accurate way. A case study is conducted with the \{BM\} patents related to postage metering system and the analysis result is presented in a positioning map that shows different knowledge flow patterns of technological classes. Moreover, the technology-based \{BM\} patents as knowledge flow drivers are classified based on the amount of knowledge exchanged between the base \{BM\} patents and their patent citations. }

To carry out the study, powerful statistical tools have been applied, such as Bayesian classifiers, decision trees or contingency tables, among other data mining techniques. Statistical analyses have been performed using Weka software and behavioral patterns based on certain rules have been obtained. From these rules, some conclusions are extracted which can help to develop suitable prevention policies to reduce injuries and fatalities. }

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies have applied various methodologies to analyze patent data for technology management, given the advances in data analysis techniques available. In particular, efforts have recently been made to use text-mining (i.e. extracting keywords from patent documents) for patent analysis purposes. The results of these studies may be affected by the keywords selected from the relevant documents – but, despite its importance, the existing literature has seldom explored strategies for selecting and processing keywords from patent documents. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap by focusing on keyword strategies for applying text-mining to patent data. Specifically, four factors are addressed; (1) which element of the patent documents to adopt for keyword selection, (2) what keyword selection methods to use, (3) how many keywords to select, and (4) how to transform the keyword selection results into an analyzable data format. An experiment based on an orthogonal array of the four factors was designed in order to identify the best strategy, in which the four factors were evaluated and compared through k-means clustering and entropy values. The research findings are expected to offer useful guidelines for how to select and process keywords for patent analysis, and so further increase the reliability and validity of research using text-mining for patent analysis. }

Different from data in traditional static databases, ubiquitous data streams typically arrive continuously in high speed with huge amount, and changing data distribution. Dealing with and extracting useful information from that data is a real challenge. This raises new issues, that need to be considered when developing association rule mining techniques for these data. It should be noted, that data, in the real world, are not represented in binary and numeric forms only, but it may be represented in quantitative values. Thus, using fuzzy sets will be very suitable to handle these values. In this paper the problem of mining fuzzy association rules from ubiquitous data streams is studied, and a novel technique FFP_USTREAM (Fuzzy Frequent Pattern Ubiquitous Streams) is developed. This technique integrates fuzzy concepts with ubiquitous data streams, employing sliding window approach, to mine fuzzy association rules. In addition, the complexity and the efficiency of this technique are discussed. Examples of real data sets are used to test the proposed technique. Further research issues are also suggested. }

Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and \{HCI\} theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students’ participation in the \{CSCL\} (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of \{VMTwG\} trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the \{GP\} algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed. }

Existing research has been focused on extraction, classification and summarization of opinions from reviews in news websites, forums and blogs. An important issue that has not been well studied is the degree of relevance between a review and its corresponding article. Prior work simply divides reviews into two classes: spam and non-spam, neglecting that the non-spam reviews could have different degrees of relevance to the article. In this paper, we propose a notion of “Review Pertinence” to study the degree of this relevance. Unlike usual methods, we measure the pertinence of review by considering not only the similarity between a review and its corresponding article, but also the correlation among reviews. Experiment results based on real data sets collected from a number of popular portal sites show the obvious effectiveness of our method in ranking reviews based on their pertinence, compared with three baseline methods. Thus, our method can be applied to efficiently retrieve reviews for opinion fusion and mining and filter review spam in practice. }

The primary purpose for which \{DMOP\} has been developed is the automation of algorithm and model selection through semantic meta-mining that makes use of an ontology-based meta-analysis of complete data mining processes in view of extracting patterns associated with mining performance. To this end, \{DMOP\} contains detailed descriptions of data mining tasks (e.g., learning, feature selection), data, algorithms, hypotheses such as mined models or patterns, and workflows. A development methodology was used for DMOP, including items such as competency questions and foundational ontology reuse. Several non-trivial modeling problems were encountered and due to the complexity of the data mining details, the ontology requires the use of the \{OWL\} 2 \{DL\} profile. \{DMOP\} was successfully evaluated for semantic meta-mining and used in constructing the Intelligent Discovery Assistant, deployed at the popular data mining environment RapidMiner. }

Different from traditional fuzzy data mining, fuzzy utility mining considers not only quantities of items in transactions but also their profits for deriving high fuzzy utility itemsets. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy utility measure with the fuzzy minimum operator to evaluate the fuzzy utilities of itemsets. Besides, an effective fuzzy utility upper-bound model based on the proposed measure is designed to provide the downward-closure property in fuzzy sets, thus reducing the search space of finding high fuzzy utility itemsets. A two-phase fuzzy utility mining algorithm, named TPFU, is also proposed and described for solving the problem of fuzzy utility mining. At last, the experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed algorithm has good performance. }

For an infinite big data scenario, the underlying data distribution of newly arrived data may be appeared differently from the old one in the real world. This phenomenon is so-called the concept-drift problem that exists commonly in the scenario of big data mining. In the past decade, decision tree inductions use multi-tree learning to detect the drift using alternative trees as a solution. However, multi-tree algorithms consume more computing resources than the singletree. This paper proposes a singletree with an optimized node-splitting mechanism to detect the drift in a test-then-training tree-building process. In the experiment, we compare the performance of the new method to some state-of-art singletree and multi-tree algorithms. Result shows that the new algorithm performs with good accuracy while a more compact model size and less use of memory than the others. }

We aimed at 2D-localization within a range of 10&#xa0;m, and at the determination of a miner’s distance within a range of 50&#xa0;m. Our system consists of a base station located at the machine’s side that comprises a set of six loudspeakers, and mobile tags that are worn by the miners. Individual sound signals are emitted by the loudspeakers and received at a mobile tag via a microphone that is mounted on the miner’s hard hat. Our system not only provides continuous estimates of the miners’ positions, but also yields estimates of the velocity and direction of their movement. We have evaluated the performance of our system in a parking-garage and in a training-mine. With regard to the stationary localization, our results show that our system provides an accuracy down to below 25&#xa0;cm and a precision lower than 2&#xa0;cm. }

In paragraph extension, a document is considered as a set of paragraphs and a paragraph merging technique is used to merge similar consecutive paragraphs until no similar consecutive paragraphs left. Following this, similar word counts in merged paragraphs are summed up to construct subtopic scores by using a corpus which is designed so that we can find words related to a subtopic. The paragraph vectors are represented by subtopics instead of the words. The subtopic of a paragraph is the most frequent one in the paragraph vector. On the other hand, topic of the document is the most dispersive subtopic in the document. An experimental topic/subtopic corpus is constructed for sport and education topics. We also supported corpus by WordNet to obtain synonyms words. We evaluate the proposed method on a data set contains randomly selected 40 documents from the education and sport topics. The experiment results show that average of topic detection success ratio is about %83 and the subtopic detection is about %68. }

The objective is to identify knowledge areas, skills and expertise relevant to jobs in the construction industry. We utilized the fast growing online job search engines to understand the construction job market and employer expectations. Over 20,000 job advertisements were downloaded from various websites between Oct 14th 2012 and March 15th 2013. We developed a text mining method to identify derived job qualification information from the downloaded pages. The developed algorithm is capable to derive rules by automatically extracting statistically significant patterns present inside preselected qualifications. The selection rules can then be used to detect the presence of these qualifications in new pages. Once the qualifications are identified, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify groups of skills that are required by employers. One of the major advantages of implementing \{LDA\} model is that it is an unsupervised approach and no training is needed. The algorithm was applied to a case study as an illustrative example. }

These information systems should provide tourism consumers and service providers with the most relevant information, more decision support, greater mobility and the most enjoyable travel experiences. As a consequence, Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) not only have to respond by adopting new technologies, but also by interpreting and using the knowledge created by the use of these techniques. This work presents the design of a general and non-invasive web mining system, built using the minimum information stored in a web server (the content of the website and the information from the log files stored in Common Log Format (CLF)) and its application to the Bidasoa Turismo (BTw) website. The proposed system combines web usage and content mining techniques with the three following main objectives: generating user navigation profiles to be used for link prediction; enriching the profiles with semantic information to diversify them, which provides the \{DMO\} with a tool to introduce links that will match the users taste; and moreover, obtaining global and language-dependent user interest profiles, which provides the \{DMO\} staff with important information for future web designs, and allows them to design future marketing campaigns for specific targets. The system performed successfully, obtaining profiles which fit in more than 60% of cases with the real user navigation sequences and in more than 90% of cases with the user interests. Moreover the automatically extracted semantic structure of the website and the interest profiles were validated by the \{BTw\} \{DMO\} staff, who found the knowledge provided to be very useful for the future. }

Different than the traditional find-all-then-prune approach, a heuristic method is proposed to extract mostly associated patterns (MASPs). This approach utilizes a maximally-association constraint to generate patterns without searching the entire lattice of item combinations. This approach does not require a pruning process. The proposed approach requires less computational resources in terms of time and memory requirements while generating a long sequence of patterns that have the highest co-occurrence. Furthermore, k-item patterns can be obtained thanks to the sub-lattice property of the MASPs. In addition, the algorithm produces a tree of the detected patterns; this tree can assist decision makers for visual analysis of data. The outcome of the algorithm implemented is illustrated using traffic accident data. The proposed approach has a potential to be utilized in big data analytics. }

One important step in this setting is the Preference Elicitation task which consists in providing the user ways to inform his/her choice on pairs of objects with a minimal effort. In this paper we propose an automatic preference elicitation method based on mining techniques. The method consists in extracting a user profile from a set of user preference samples. In our setting, a profile is specified by a set of contextual preference rules verifying properties of soundness and conciseness. After proving that the problem is NP-complete, we propose a resolution in 2 phases. The first phase extracts all individual user preferences by means of contextual preference rules. The second phase builds the user profile starting from this collection of rules using a greedy method. To assess the quality of user profiles, we propose three ranking techniques benefiting from these profiles that enable us to rank objects according to user preferences. We evaluate the efficacy of our three ranking strategies and compare them with a well-known ranking method (SVMRank). The evaluation is carried out through an extensive set of experiments executed on a real-world database of user preferences about movies. }

Searches were performed in relevant journals resulting in 219 articles published between 2002 and 2013. To analyze such a large number of manuscripts, text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains. Moreover, the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used in order to group articles in several relevant topics. The analysis was conducted using a dictionary of terms belonging to both banking and business intelligence domains. Such procedure allowed for the identification of relationships between terms and topics grouping articles, enabling to emerge hypotheses regarding research directions. To confirm such hypotheses, relevant articles were collected and scrutinized, allowing to validate the text mining procedure. The results show that credit in banking is clearly the main application trend, particularly predicting risk and thus supporting credit approval or denial. There is also a relevant interest in bankruptcy and fraud prediction. Customer retention seems to be associated, although weakly, with targeting, justifying bank offers to reduce churn. In addition, a large number of articles focused more on business intelligence techniques and its applications, using the banking industry just for evaluation, thus, not clearly acclaiming for benefits in the banking business. By identifying these current research topics, this study also highlights opportunities for future research. }

  abstract = {Abstract Most complex data structures can be represented by a tree or graph structure, but tree structure mining is easier than graph structure mining. With the extensive application of semi-structured data, frequent tree pattern mining has become a hot topic. This paper proposes a compression tree sequence (CTS) to construct a compression tree model; and save the information of the original tree in the compression tree. As any subsequence of the \{CTS\} corresponds to a subtree of the original tree, it is efficient for mining subtrees. Furthermore, this paper proposes a frequent maximal induced subtrees mining method based on the compression tree sequence, \{CFMIS\} (compressed frequent maximal induced subtrees). The algorithm is primarily performed via four stages: firstly, the original data set is constructed as a compression tree model; then, a cut-edge reprocess is run for the edges in which the edge frequent is less than the threshold; next, the tree is compressed after the cut-edge based on the different frequent edge degrees; and, last, frequent subtree sets maximal processing is run such that, we can obtain the frequent maximal induced subtree set of the original data set. For each iteration, compression can reduce the size of the data set, thus, the traversal speed is faster than that of other algorithms. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can mine more frequent maximal induced subtrees in less time. }

We present a system for extracting disease–gene associations from biomedical abstracts. The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16%. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the \{DISEASES\} resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease–gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The \{DISEASES\} resource is accessible through a web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download. }

However, most text mining algorithms would require manual reading to merge extracted product features with synonyms. In response, Topic modeling is introduced to group synonyms together under a topic automatically, leading to convenient and accurate evaluation of brands based on consumers’ online reviews. To ensure the feasibility of employing Topic modeling in assessing competitive brands, we developed a unique and novel framework named \{WVAP\} (Weights from Valid Posterior Probability) based on Scree plot technique. \{WVAP\} can filter the noises in posterior distribution obtained from Topic modeling, and improve accuracy in brand evaluation. A case study exploring online reviews of mobile phones is conducted. We extract topics to reflect the features of the cell phones with a qualified validity. In addition to perceptual maps derived by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) for product positioning, we also rank these products by \{TOPSIS\} (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) so as to visualize the market structure from different perspectives. Our case study of cell phones shows that the proposed framework is effective in mining online reviews and providing insights into the competitive landscape. }

The recent emergence of some data mining techniques provide also many interesting induction rules. So, it is judicious now to process these induction rules in order to extract some new strong patterns called meta-rules. This work explores this concept by proposing a new support for induction rules clustering and classification. The approach invokes k-means and k-nn algorithms to mine induction rules using new designed similarity measures and gravity center computation. The developed module have been implemented in the core of the cognitive agent, in order to speed up its reasoning. This new architecture called the Miner Intelligent Agent (MIA) is tested and evaluated on four public benchmarks that contain 25,000 rules, and finally it is compared to the classical one. As foreseeable, the \{MIA\} outperforms clearly the classical cognitive agent performances. }

Existing approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to estimate patterns’ relevance to the given strategic problem. The provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further – already evaluated – approach processed without using idea mining. The results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little expressive strength. }

The concept and methods are applied in the shutdown of drinking water supply at the city of Toledo, Ohio, USA. Toledo's notice, which persisted from August 1 to 4, 2014, is a high-profile event that directly influenced approximately half a million people and received wide recognition. The notice was given when excessive levels of microcystin, a byproduct of cyanobacteria blooms, were discovered at the drinking water treatment plant on Lake Erie. Twitter mining results illustrated an instant response to the Toledo incident, the associated collective knowledge, and public perception. The results from Google Trends, on the other hand, revealed how the Toledo event raised public attention on the associated environmental issue, harmful algal blooms, in a long-term context. Thus, when jointly applied, Twitter and Google Trend analysis results offer complementary perspectives. Web content aggregated through mining approaches provides a social standpoint, such as public perception and interest, and offers context for establishing and evaluating environmental management policies. }

  abstract = {Abstract As the amount of genome information increases rapidly, there is a correspondingly greater need for methods that provide accurate and automated annotation of gene function. For example, many high-throughput technologies – e.g., next-generation sequencing – are being used today to generate lists of genes associated with specific conditions. However, their functional interpretation remains a challenge and many tools exist trying to characterize the function of gene-lists. Such systems rely typically in enrichment analysis and aim to give a quick insight into the underlying biology by presenting it in a form of a summary-report. While the load of annotation may be alleviated by such computational approaches, the main challenge in modern annotation remains to develop a systems form of analysis in which a pipeline can effectively analyze gene-lists quickly and identify aggregated annotations through computerized resources. In this article we survey some of the many such tools and methods that have been developed to automatically interpret the biological functions underlying gene-lists. We overview current functional annotation aspects from the perspective of their epistemology (i.e., the underlying theories used to organize information about gene function into a body of verified and documented knowledge) and find that most of the currently used functional annotation methods fall broadly into one of two categories: they are based either on ‘known’ formally-structured ontology annotations created by ‘experts’ (e.g., the \{GO\} terms used to describe the function of Entrez Gene entries), or – perhaps more adventurously – on annotations inferred from literature (e.g., many text-mining methods use computer-aided reasoning to acquire knowledge represented in natural languages). Overall however, deriving detailed and accurate insight from such gene lists remains a challenging task, and improved methods are called for. In particular, future methods need to (1) provide more holistic insight into the underlying molecular systems; (2) provide better follow-up experimental testing and treatment options, and (3) better manage gene lists derived from organisms that are not well-studied. We discuss some promising approaches that may help achieve these advances, especially the use of extended dictionaries of biomedical concepts and molecular mechanisms, as well as greater use of annotation benchmarks. }

  abstract = {Abstract As one of the important approaches in privacy preserving data mining, privacy preserving utility mining has been studied to find more meaningful results while database privacy is ensured and to improve algorithm efficiency by integrating fundamental utility pattern mining and privacy preserving data mining methods. However, its previous approaches require a significant amount of time to protect the privacy of data holders because they conduct database scanning operations excessively many times until all important information is hidden. Moreover, as the size of a given database becomes larger and a user-specified minimum utility threshold becomes lower, their performance degradation may be so uncontrollable that they cannot operate normally. To solve this problem, we propose a fast perturbation algorithm based on a tree structure which more quickly performs database perturbation processes for preventing sensitive information from being exposed. We also present extensive experimental results between our proposed method and state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and synthetic datasets. They show the proposed method has not only outstanding privacy preservation performance that is comparable to the previous ones but also 5–10 times faster runtime than that of the existing approaches on average. In addition, the proposed algorithm guarantees better scalability than that of the latest ones with respect to databases with the characteristics of gradually increasing attributes and transactions. }

  abstract = {Abstract Clinical evaluation of patients and diagnosis of disorder is crucial to make decisions on appropriate therapies. In addition, in the case of genetic disorders resulting from gene abnormalities, phenotypic effects may guide basic research on the mechanisms of a disorder to find the mutated gene and therefore to propose novel targets for drug therapy. However, this approach is complicated by two facts. First, the relationship between genes and disorders is not simple: one gene may be related to multiple disorders and a disorder may be caused by mutations in different genes. Second, recognizing relevant phenotypes might be difficult for clinicians working with patients of closely related complex disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders best illustrate these difficulties since phenotypes range from metabolic to behavioral aspects, the latter extremely complex. Based on our clinical expertise on five neurodegenerative disorders, and from the wealth of bibliographical data on neuropsychiatric disorders, we have built a resource to infer associations between genes, chemicals, phenotypes for a total of 31 disorders. An initial step of automated text mining of the literature related to 31 disorders returned thousands of enriched terms. Fewer relevant phenotypic terms were manually selected by clinicians as relevant to the five neural disorders of their expertise and used to analyze the complete set of disorders. Analysis of the data indicates general relationships between neuropsychiatric disorders, which can be used to classify and characterize them. Correlation analyses allowed us to propose novel associations of genes and drugs with disorders. More generally, the results led us to uncovering mechanisms of disease that span multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, for example that genes related to synaptic transmission and receptor functions tend to be involved in many disorders, whereas genes related to sensory perception and channel transport functions are associated with fewer disorders. Our study shows that starting from expertise covering a limited set of neurological disorders and using text and data mining methods, meaningful and novel associations regarding genes, chemicals and phenotypes can be derived for an expanded set of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results are intended for clinicians to help them evaluate patients, and for basic scientists to propose new gene targets for drug therapies. This strategy can be extended to virtually all diseases and takes advantage of the ever increasing amount of biomedical literature. }

Scientific papers and technological patents record modern and advanced knowledge in scientific discovery and technological development; therefore, comparing their statuses can identify the gaps and explore potential technological opportunities. Because microalgal biofuels are a promising alternative energy resource devoid of territorial land use problems, this study applies text mining and an algorithm that can cluster objects of high-dimensional data to microalgal biofuel papers and patents, and explores their potential technological opportunities. The results demonstrate that a text-based clustering approach is appropriate for identifying scientific and technological applications for microalgal biofuels. The results indicate that microalgal photosynthesis and light utilization have abundant scientific outcomes for technological engineers to potentially apply. Technological opportunities exist in synthesis, harvesting, extraction, and lipid conversion. Scientific knowledge underlying biofuels accompanying high-value co-products of production require sustained exploration and reporting through research. These needs represent potential technological opportunities. }

However, the associated rapid increase in digital data volumes does not automatically correlate with new insights and advances in our understanding of those data. The relatively new technique of data mining offers a promising way to extract knowledge and patterns from large, multidimensional and complex data sets. This paper therefore aims to provide a comprehensive overview of existing data mining techniques and related tools and to illustrate the potential of data mining for different research areas by means of example applications. Despite a number of conventional data mining techniques and methods, these classical approaches are restricted to isolated or “silo” data sets and therefore remain primarily stand alone and specialized in nature. Highly complex and mostly interdisciplinary questions in environmental research cannot be answered sufficiently using isolated or area-based data mining approaches. To this end, the linked open data (LOD) approach will be presented as a new possibility in support of complex and inter-disciplinary data mining analysis. The merit of \{LOD\} will be explained using examples from medicine and environmental research. The advantages of \{LOD\} data mining will be weighed against classical data mining techniques. \{LOD\} offers unique and new possibilities for interdisciplinary data analysis, modeling and projection for multidimensional, complex landscapes and may facilitate new insights and answers to complex environmental questions. Our paper aims to encourage those research scientists which do not have extensive programming and data mining knowledge to take advantage of existing data mining tools, to embrace classical data mining and \{LOD\} approaches in support of gaining more insight and recognizing patterns in highly complex data sets. }

This requires precise knowledge of the customer's preferences. For this reason, holders of e-shops must find out to whom, to what, how and when to refer to the customer, ergo, to know the “consumer decision journey” and strengthen their engagement. This analysis is obtained when the customer is visiting an e-shop because (s)he leaves a digital footprint that can be used to understand his/her needs, desires and demands as well as to improve web presence. These data can be used for data mining to understand the e-marketing and selling processes in a better way. In this paper a survey of 86 e-shops in Spain is presented. In the conclusions, some ideas for good e-marketing practices related to the buying behaviour analysis of customers are shown. Hence, new trends in e-marketing are suggested from a strategic, tactical and operational level in which different data mining techniques ease the purchase and the engagement. }

Therefore, the mining of top-rank-k frequent patterns, which limits the number of mined frequent patterns by ranking them in frequency, has received increasing interest. This paper proposes the iNTK algorithm, which is an improved version of the \{NTK\} algorithm, for mining top-rank-k frequent patterns. This algorithm employs an N-list structure to represent patterns. The subsume concept is used to speed up the process of mining top-rank-k patterns. The experiments are conducted to evaluate iNTK and \{NTK\} in terms of mining time and memory usage for eight datasets. The experimental results show that iNTK is more efficient and faster than NTK. }

They can be either static or dynamic, dependently on whether the modeled interactions are fixed or changeable over time. Static networks have been extensively investigated in data mining, while fewer studies have focused on dynamic networks and how to discover complex patterns in large, evolving networks. In this paper we focus on the task of discovering changes in evolving networks and we overcome some limits of existing methods (i) by resorting to a relational approach for representing networks characterized by heterogeneous nodes and/or heterogeneous relationships, and (ii) by proposing a novel algorithm for discovering changes in the structure of a dynamic network over time. Experimental results and comparisons with existing approaches on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution and provide some insights on the effect of some parameters in discovering and modeling the evolution of the whole network, or a subpart of it. }

Moreover, the textual descriptions are often overly specific to the video content. Such characteristics make it very challenging to discover topics at a satisfactory granularity on this kind of data. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model named Preference-Topic Model (PTM) to introduce the dimension of user preferences to enhance the insufficient textual information. \{PTM\} is a unified framework to combine the tasks of user preference discovery and document topic mining together. Through modeling user-document interactions, \{PTM\} cannot only discover topics and preferences simultaneously, but also enable them to inform and benefit each other in a unified framework. As a result, \{PTM\} can extract better topics and preferences from sparse data. The experimental results on real-life video application data show that \{PTM\} is superior to \{LDA\} in discovering informative topics and preferences in terms of clustering-based evaluations. Furthermore, the experimental results on \{DBLP\} data demonstrate that \{PTM\} is a general model which can be applied to other kinds of user–document interactions. }

Specifically, lighting, plug loads, \{HVAC\} equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10&#xa0;min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules.

  abstract = {Abstract Hotel managers continue to find ways to understand traveler preferences, with the aim of improving their strategic planning, marketing, and product development. Traveler preference is unpredictable; for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences. }

In this paper, we present an automatic approach, called domain-specific facet (DF)-Miner, to discover \{DFs\} based on the hyperlink structure within the Wikipedia article pages. Each article page corresponds to a domain-specific term. The hyperlink structures among article pages represent the connections among these terms. The community structure of the connections among a domain-specific term set reveals the facets of the domain. The terms with more connections provide important clues for facet labeling. Accordingly, DF-Miner first constructs a domain-specific hyperlink graph from the Wikipedia article pages. Then it extracts a tree structure from the Wikipedia category pages. DF-Miner groups the terms of a domain into multiple facets based on the result of community detection. Finally, DF-Miner selects a meaningful label for each facet based on the connection number of terms and the extracted tree structure from the category pages. Two experiments were conducted with six real-world datasets to evaluate DF-Miner. The experimental results show that DF-Miner performs better than the textual content-based approaches. }

It is critical to understand the phenomenon of rockburst, focusing on the patterns of occurrence so these events can be avoided and/or managed saving costs and possibly lives. The failure mechanism of rockburst needs to be better understood. Laboratory experiments are undergoing at the Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering (SKLGDUE) of Beijing and the system is described. A large number of rockburst tests were performed and their information collected, stored in a database and analyzed. Data Mining (DM) techniques were applied to the database in order to develop predictive models for the rockburst maximum stress (σRB) and rockburst risk index (IRB) that need the results of such tests to be determined. With the developed models it is possible to predict these parameters with high accuracy levels using data from the rock mass and specific project. }

It is essential to investigate how other factors besides the Braden scale could enhance the prediction of pressure ulcers. Data mining modeling techniques can be beneficial to conduct this type of analysis. Data mining techniques have been applied extensively in health care, but are not widely used in nursing research. Purpose To remedy this methodological gap, this paper will review, explain, and compare several data mining models to examine patient level factors associated with pressure ulcers based on a four year study from military hospitals in the United States. Methods The variables included in the analysis are easily accessible demographic information and medical measurements. Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and multivariate adaptive regression splines were compared based on their performance and interpretability. Results The random forests model had the highest accuracy (C-statistic) with the following variables, in order of importance, ranked highest in predicting pressure ulcers: days in the hospital, serum albumin, age, blood urea nitrogen, and total Braden score. Conclusion Data mining, particularly, random forests are useful in predictive modeling. It is important for hospitals and health care systems to use their own data over time for pressure ulcer risk prediction, to develop risk models based upon more than the total Braden score, and specific to their patient population. }

Traditional data mining methods often require the experts in analytic domains to annotate the data. However, it is expensive and usually takes a long time. Crowdsourcing enables the use of heterogeneous background knowledge from volunteers and distributes the annotation process to small portions of efforts from different contributions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-arts on the crowdsourcing for data mining in recent years. We first review the challenges and opportunities of data mining tasks using crowdsourcing, and summarize the framework of them. Then we highlight several exemplar works in each component of the framework, including question designing, data mining and quality control. Finally, we conclude the limitation of crowdsourcing for data mining and suggest related areas for future research. }

The recent development of high-throughput technologies has led to an explosion of biological data and has enabled mining biomarkers and drug targets in a more systematic way. Bioinformatic and biostatistical approaches are skilled at dealing with large data sets and therefore widely used in mining disease biomarkers and drug targets in this “omic” era.

  abstract = {Abstract Probabilistic topic models are unsupervised generative models which model document content as a two-step generation process, that is, documents are observed as mixtures of latent concepts or topics, while topics are probability distributions over vocabulary words. Recently, a significant research effort has been invested into transferring the probabilistic topic modeling concept from monolingual to multilingual settings. Novel topic models have been designed to work with parallel and comparable texts. We define multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM) and present the first full overview of the current research, methodology, advantages and limitations in MuPTM. As a representative example, we choose a natural extension of the omnipresent \{LDA\} model to multilingual settings called bilingual \{LDA\} (BiLDA). We provide a thorough overview of this representative multilingual model from its high-level modeling assumptions down to its mathematical foundations. We demonstrate how to use the data representation by means of output sets of (i) per-topic word distributions and (ii) per-document topic distributions coming from a multilingual probabilistic topic model in various real-life cross-lingual tasks involving different languages, without any external language pair dependent translation resource: (1) cross-lingual event-centered news clustering, (2) cross-lingual document classification, (3) cross-lingual semantic similarity, and (4) cross-lingual information retrieval. We also briefly review several other applications present in the relevant literature, and introduce and illustrate two related modeling concepts: topic smoothing and topic pruning. In summary, this article encompasses the current research in multilingual probabilistic topic modeling. By presenting a series of potential applications, we reveal the importance of the language-independent and language pair independent data representations by means of MuPTM. We provide clear directions for future research in the field by providing a systematic overview of how to link and transfer aspect knowledge across corpora written in different languages via the shared space of latent cross-lingual topics, that is, how to effectively employ learned per-topic word distributions and per-document topic distributions of any multilingual probabilistic topic model in various cross-lingual applications. }

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors’ sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. }

  abstract = {Abstract The quality of the interpretation of the sentiment in the online buzz in the social media and the online news can determine the predictability of financial markets and cause huge gains or losses. That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. }

We display a combination of factorial projections, \{SOM\} algorithm and graph techniques applied to a text mining problem. The corpus contains eight medieval manuscripts which were used to teach arithmetic techniques to merchants. Among the techniques for Data Analysis, those used for Lexicometry (such as Factorial Analysis) highlight the discrepancies between manuscripts. The reason for this is that they focus on the deviation from the independence between words and manuscripts. Still, we also want to discover and characterize the common vocabulary among the whole corpus. Using the properties of stochastic Kohonen maps, which define neighborhood between inputs in a non-deterministic way, we highlight the words which seem to play a special role in the vocabulary. We call them fickle and use them to improve both Kohonen map robustness and significance of \{FCA\} visualization. Finally we use graph algorithmic to exploit this fickleness for classification of words. }

Although many studies have dealt with \{TRMs\} that are designed primarily for a market-driven technology planning process, a technology-driven \{TRM\} is far less researched than a market-driven one. Furthermore, approaches to a technology-driven roadmap using quantitative technological information have rarely been studied. Thus, the aim of this research is to propose a new methodological framework to identify both profitable markets and promising product concepts based on technology information. This study suggests two quality function deployment (QFD) matrices to draw up the \{TRM\} in order to find new business opportunities. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed approach using patents on the solar-lighting devices, which is catching on as a high-tech way to prevent environmental pollution and reduce fuel costs. }

The objective is to cluster all stories in the data streams into hierarchical structure for a better serve to the readers. The work utilizes segment wise distributional clustering that show the effectiveness of data streams. To better serve the news readers, advance data organization is highly desired. Once catching a glimpse of the topic, user can browse the returned hierarchy and find other stories/feeds talking about the same topic in the internet. The dynamically changing of stories needs to use the segment wise distributional clustering algorithm to have the capability to process information incrementally. }

Using San Mateo County, California, as a case study, a non-mutually exclusive supervised classification algorithm with natural language processing techniques is applied to analyze sustainability content in news articles and compare the results with \{SI\} reports created by Sustainable San Mateo County (SSMC) using traditional methods. Results showed that the text mining approach could identify all of the indicators highlighted as important in the reports and that the method has potential for identifying region-specific SI, as well as providing insights on the underlying causes of sustainability problems. }

It considers both users' conversation and interaction data in group-chats to discover overlapping users' interests and their social ties. The proposed framework applies n-gram technique in association with a self-customized hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm to identify key-terms representing users' interests, key-users, and key-sessions. We propose a social graph generation technique to model users' interactions, where ties (edges) between a pair of users (nodes) are established only if they participate in at least one common group-chat session, and weights are assigned to the ties based on the degree of overlap in users' interests and interactions. Finally, we present three possible cyber-crime investigation scenarios and a user-group identification method for each of them. We present our experimental results on a data set comprising 1100 chat logs of 11,143 chat sessions continued over a period of 29 months from January 2010 to May 2012. Experimental results suggest that the proposed framework is able to identify key-terms, key-users, key-sessions, and user-groups from chat logs data, all of which are crucial for cyber-crime investigation. Though the chat logs are recovered from a single computer, it is very likely that the logs are collected from multiple computers in real scenario. In this case, logs collected from multiple computers can be combined together to generate more enriched social graph. However, our experiments show that the objectives can be achieved even with logs recovered from a single computer by using group-chats data to draw relationships between every pair of users. }

  abstract = {Abstract This work proposes an extension of Bing Liu’s aspect-based opinion mining approach in order to apply it to the tourism domain. The extension concerns with the fact that users refer differently to different kinds of products when writing reviews on the Web. Since Liu’s approach is focused on physical product reviews, it could not be directly applied to the tourism domain, which presents features that are not considered by the model. Through a detailed study of on-line tourism product reviews, we found these features and then model them in our extension, proposing the use of new and more complex NLP-based rules for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification at the aspect-level. We also entail the task of opinion visualization and summarization and propose new methods to help users digest the vast availability of opinions in an easy manner. Our work also included the development of a generic architecture for an aspect-based opinion mining tool, which we then used to create a prototype and analyze opinions from TripAdvisor in the context of the tourism industry in Los Lagos, a Chilean administrative region also known as the Lake District. Results prove that our extension is able to perform better than Liu’s model in the tourism domain, improving both Accuracy and Recall for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification. Particularly, the approach is very effective in determining the sentiment orientation of opinions, achieving an F-measure of 92% for the task. However, on average, the algorithms were only capable of extracting 35% of the explicit aspect expressions, using a non-extended approach for this task. Finally, results also showed the effectiveness of our design when applied to solving the industry’s specific issues in the Lake District, since almost 80% of the users that used our tool considered that our tool adds valuable information to their business. }

Methods Clinical issues based on data mining models were comprehensively summarized from four significant elements of the clinical studies: symptoms, symptom patterns, herbs, and efficacy. Existing problems were further generalized to determine the relevant factors of the performance of data mining models, e.g. data type, samples, parameters, variable labels. Combining these relevant factors, the \{TCM\} clinical data features were compared with regards to statistical characters and informatics properties. Data models were compared simultaneously from the view of applied conditions and suitable scopes. Results The main application problems were the inconsistent data type and the small samples for the used data mining models, which caused the inappropriate results, even the mistake results. These features, i.e. advantages, disadvantages, satisfied data types, tasks of data mining, and the \{TCM\} issues, were summarized and compared. Conclusion By aiming at the special features of different data mining models, the clinical doctors could select the suitable data mining models to resolve the \{TCM\} problem. }

  abstract = {Abstract The object-oriented approach has been the most popular software design methodology for the past twenty-five years. Several design patterns and principles are defined to improve the design quality of object-oriented software systems. In addition, designers can use unique design motifs that are designed for the specific application domains. Another commonly used technique is cloning and modifying some parts of the software while creating new modules. Therefore, object-oriented programs can include many identical design structures. This work proposes a sub-graph mining-based approach for detecting identical design structures in object-oriented systems. By identifying and analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful information about the design, such as commonly-used design patterns, most frequent design defects, domain-specific patterns, and reused design clones, which could help developers to improve their knowledge about the software architecture. Furthermore, problematic parts of frequent identical design structures are appropriate refactoring opportunities because they affect multiple areas of the architecture. Experiments with several open-source and industrial projects show that we can successfully find many identical design structures within a project (intra-project) and between different projects (inter-project). We observe that usually most of the detected identical structures are an implementation of common design patterns; however, we also detect various anti-patterns, domain-specific patterns, reused design parts and design-level clones. }

In the educational context outcome feedback is usually applied to improve learning achievements. However, not many research publications have been written observing the characteristics of a modeling process itself that can be associated with better/worse learning outcomes, nor have any empirically validated results been reported on the observations of modeling activities in the educational context. This paper attempts to cover this gap for conceptual modeling. We analyze modeling behavior (conceptual modeling event data of 20 cases, 10.000 events in total) using experimental logging functionality of the \{JMermaid\} modeling tool and process mining techniques. The outcomes of the work include modeling patterns that are indicative for worse/better learning performance. The results contribute to (1) improving teaching guidance for conceptual modeling targeted at process-oriented feedback, (2) providing recommendations on the type of data that can be useful in observing a modeling behavior from the perspective of learning outcomes. In addition, the study provides first insights for learning analytics research in the domain of conceptual modeling. }

  abstract = {Abstract The idiosyncrasy of the Web has, in the last few years, been altered by Web 2.0 technologies and applications and the advent of the so-called Social Web. While users were merely information consumers in the traditional Web, they play a much more active role in the Social Web since they are now also data providers. The mass involved in the process of creating Web content has led many public and private organizations to focus their attention on analyzing this content in order to ascertain the general public’s opinions as regards a number of topics. Given the current Web size and growth rate, automated techniques are essential if practical and scalable solutions are to be obtained. Opinion mining is a highly active research field that comprises natural language processing, computational linguistics and text analysis techniques with the aim of extracting various kinds of added-value and informational elements from users’ opinions. However, current opinion mining approaches are hampered by a number of drawbacks such as the absence of semantic relations between concepts in feature search processes or the lack of advanced mathematical methods in sentiment analysis processes. In this paper we propose an innovative opinion mining methodology that takes advantage of new Semantic Web-guided solutions to enhance the results obtained with traditional natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis processes. The main goals of the proposed methodology are: (1) to improve feature-based opinion mining by using ontologies at the feature selection stage, and (2) to provide a new vector analysis-based method for sentiment analysis. The methodology has been implemented and thoroughly tested in a real-world movie review-themed scenario, yielding very promising results when compared with other conventional approaches. }

  abstract = {Abstract Massive amounts of unstructured data are being collected from online sources, such as e-mails, call center transcripts, wikis, online bulletin boards, blogs, tweets, Web pages, and so on. The R programming language contains a rich collection of packages and functions for analyzing unstructured text data. Functions include those for identifying unique words and their corresponding occurrence frequencies, a process known as tokenizing. Other functions provide a means for cleansing text data, such as removal of white space and punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing less meaningful words through a stop word list. Apache Hive functions also provide the means for tokenizing large amounts of text using the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Text data that have been reduced to a more manageable size using Hive functions can be further analyzed using the R language's vast array text processing and advanced analytical functions. }

This data provide a wealth of information about user behaviours and their potential is increasing, as it becomes ever-more common for images to be associated with location information in the form of geo-tags. Recently, there is an increasing tendency to adopt the information from these geo-tagged photos for learning to recommend tourist locations. In this paper, we aim to propose a system to recommend interesting tourist locations and interesting tourist travel sequences (i.e., sequence of tourist locations) from a collection of geo-tagged photos. Proposed system is capable of understanding context (i.e., time, date, and weather), as well as taking into account the collective wisdom of people, to make tourist recommendations. We illustrate our technique on a sample of public Flickr data set. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate better recommendations as compared to other state-of-the-art landmark based recommendation methods. }

  abstract = {Abstract Online high utility itemset mining over data streams has been studied recently. However, the existing methods are not designed for producing top-k patterns. Since there could be a large number of high utility patterns, finding only top-k patterns is more attractive than producing all the patterns whose utility is above a threshold. A challenge with finding top-k high utility itemsets over data streams is that it is not easy for users to determine a proper minimum utility threshold in order for the method to work efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new method (named T-HUDS) for finding top-k high utility patterns over sliding windows of a data stream. The method is based on a compressed tree structure, called HUDS-tree, that can be used to efficiently find potential top-k high utility itemsets over sliding windows. T-HUDS uses a new utility estimation model to more effectively prune the search space. We also propose several strategies for initializing and dynamically adjusting the minimum utility threshold. We prove that no top-k high utility itemset is missed by the proposed method. Our experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that our strategies and new utility estimation model work very effectively and that T-HUDS outperforms two state-of-the-art high utility itemset algorithms substantially in terms of execution time and memory storage. }

  abstract = {Abstract Currently, power distribution companies have several problems that are related to energy losses. For example, the energy used might not be billed due to illegal manipulation or a breakdown in the customer’s measurement equipment. These types of losses are called non-technical losses (NTLs), and these losses are usually greater than the losses that are due to the distribution infrastructure (technical losses). Traditionally, a large number of studies have used data mining to detect NTLs, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that involve the use of a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) that is created based on the knowledge and expertise of the inspectors. In the present study, a \{KBS\} was built that is based on the knowledge and expertise of the inspectors and that uses text mining, neural networks, and statistical techniques for the detection of NTLs. Text mining, neural networks, and statistical techniques were used to extract information from samples, and this information was translated into rules, which were joined to the rules that were generated by the knowledge of the inspectors. This system was tested with real samples that were extracted from Endesa databases. Endesa is one of the most important distribution companies in Spain, and it plays an important role in international markets in both Europe and South America, having more than 73 million customers. }

However, the social networks have communities. In our work, we aim at mining the invisible or missing relations between individuals within a community in social networks. We propose our algorithm according to the fact that the individuals exist in communities satisfying Nash equilibrium, which is borrowed from game-theoretic concepts often used in economic researches. Each hidden relation is explored through the individual's loyalty to their community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of mining hidden links from the aspect of Nash equilibrium. Eventually we confirm our approach's superiority from extensive experiments over real-world social networks. }

This paper aims to investigate how microblogging social networks (i.e. Twitter) can be used as a reliable information source of emerging events by extracting their spatio-temporal features from the messages to enhance event awareness. In this work, we applied a density-based online clustering method for mining microblogging text streams, in order to obtain temporal and geospatial features of real-world events.

The application of \{SC\} techniques in the mining industry is fairly extensive and covers a considerable number of applications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the published work on \{SC\} applications in different mining areas. A brief introduction to mining and the general field of \{SC\} applications are presented in the first section of the paper. The second section comprises four review chapters. Mining method selection, equipment selection problems and their applications in \{SC\} technologies are presented in chapters one and two. Chapter three discusses rock mechanics-related subjects and some of representative \{SC\} applications in this field. The last chapter presents rock blasting related \{SC\} applications that include blast design and hazards. The final section of the paper comments on the use of \{SC\} applications in several mining problems and possible future applications of advanced \{SC\} technologies. }

The FR, derived from the local index numbers of terms in a sentences ordered by the global frequency of terms, provides single-term-level information. The Intimacy models relationship between a word and others, i.e. the closeness a term is to other terms in the same sentence. Two textual features “Frequency Rank Ratio (FRR)” and “Overall Intimacy (OI)” for capturing language variation are derived by employing the two proposed textual metrics. Using the derived features, language variation among documents can be visualized in a text space. Three corpora consisting of documents of diverse topics, genres, regions, and dates of writing are designed and collected to evaluate the proposed algorithms. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the feasibility and performance of our implementation. Both theoretical analyses based on entropy and the simulations demonstrate the feasibility of our method. We also show the proposed algorithm can be used for visualizing the closeness of several western languages. Variation of modern English over time is also recognizable when using our analysis method. Finally, our method is compared to conventional text classification implementations. The comparative results indicate our method outperforms the others. }

By analyzing and predicting unemployment rate, government officials can develop appropriate labor market related policies in response to the current economic situation. Accordingly, unemployment rate prediction has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. The main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel ontology-based Web mining framework that leverages search engine queries to improve the accuracy of unemployment rate prediction. The proposed framework is underpinned by a domain ontology which captures unemployment related concepts and their semantic relationships to facilitate the extraction of useful prediction features from relevant search engine queries. In addition, state-of-the-art feature selection methods and data mining models such as neural networks and support vector regressions are exploited to enhance the effectiveness of unemployment rate prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline forecasting approaches that have been widely used for unemployment rate prediction. Our empirical findings also confirm that domain ontology and search engine queries can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of unemployment rate prediction. A unique advantage of the proposed framework is that it not only improves prediction performance but also provides human comprehensible explanations for the changes of unemployment rate. The business implication of our research work is that government officials and human resources managers can utilize the proposed framework to effectively analyze unemployment rate, and hence to better develop labor market related policies. }

Opinion mining is a way to retrieve information through search engines, Web blogs and social networks. Because of the huge number of reviews in the form of unstructured text, it is impossible to summarize the information manually.

We analyzed the time gap phenomena between three resources and two academic areas by conducting text mining-based content analysis. To this end, a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to estimate the optimal time gaps among three resources (papers, patents, and web news articles) in two research domains. The contributions of this study are summarized as follows: firstly, we propose a new temporal analysis method to understand the content characteristics and trends of heterogeneous multiple resources in an integrated manner. We applied it to measure the exact time intervals between academic areas by understanding the time gap phenomena. The results of temporal analysis showed that the resources of the medical field had more up-to-date property than those of the computer field, and thus prompter disclosure to the public. Secondly, we adopted a power-law exponent measurement and content analysis to evaluate the proposed method. With the proposed method, we demonstrate how to analyze heterogeneous resources more precisely and comprehensively. }

  abstract = {Abstract There are now domains where information is recorded over a period of time, leading to sequences of data known as time series. In many domains, like medicine, time series analysis requires to focus on certain regions of interest, known as events, rather than analyzing the whole time series. In this paper, we propose a framework for knowledge discovery in both one-dimensional and multidimensional time series containing events. We show how our approach can be used to classify medical time series by means of a process that identifies events in time series, generates time series reference models of representative events and compares two time series by analyzing the events they have in common. We have applied our framework on time series generated in the areas of electroencephalography (EEG) and stabilometry. Framework performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and the results confirmed that the proposed schema has potential for classifying \{EEG\} and stabilometric signals. The proposed framework is useful for discovering knowledge from medical time series containing events, such as stabilometric and electroencephalographic time series. These results would be equally applicable to other medical domains generating iconographic time series, such as, for example, electrocardiography (ECG). }

A number of algorithms have been proposed to speed up the mining process. However, sequential algorithms are not efficient for mining \{CARs\} in large datasets while existing parallel algorithms require communication and collaboration among computing nodes which introduces the high cost of synchronization. This paper addresses these drawbacks by proposing three efficient approaches for mining \{CARs\} in large datasets relying on parallel computing. To date, this is the first study which tries to implement an algorithm for parallel mining \{CARs\} on a computer with the multi-core processor architecture. The proposed parallel algorithm is theoretically proven to be faster than existing parallel algorithms. The experimental results also show that our proposed parallel algorithm outperforms a recent sequential algorithm in mining time. }

  abstract = {Abstract With the proliferation of social media, the number of active web-users is rapidly increasing these days. They create and maintain their personal web-profiles, and use them to interact with others in the cyber-space. Currently two major problems are being faced to automatically identify these web-users and correlate their web-profiles. First is the presence of namesakes on the Web, and the second is the use of alias names. In this paper, we propose a context-based text mining approach to discover alias names for all the namesakes sharing a common name on the Web, and leave the task of selecting the namesake of interest on part of the user. The proposed method employs a search-engine \{API\} to retrieve relevant webpages for a given name. The retrieved webpages are modeled into a graph, and a clustering algorithm is applied to disambiguate the webpages. Thereafter each obtained cluster standing for a namesake is mined for alias identification following a text pattern based statistical technique. The existing research works do not consider the presence of namesakes on the Web to mine aliases, which is impractical. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in discovering this drawback of existing works. Additionally the contribution includes the disambiguation technique that does not need to have a pre-determined number of clusters to be generated and the light-weight text pattern based alias mining technique. The number of clusters in the proposed method is rather determined dynamically by the inflation parameter, the pre-determination of which is comparatively much easier. Experimental results on different components demonstrate the robustness of the proposed alias mining approach. This paper also brings forth the significance of alias mining to the problem of suspect monitoring and tracking on the Web. }

The main problem of these structures is that they both need to encode each node of a PPC-tree with pre-order and post-order code. This causes that they are memory-consuming and inconvenient to mine frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose Nodeset, a more efficient data structure, for mining frequent itemsets. Nodesets require only the pre-order (or post-order code) of each node, which makes it saves half of memory compared with N-lists and Node-lists. Based on Nodesets, we present an efficient algorithm called \{FIN\} to mining frequent itemsets. For evaluating the performance of FIN, we have conduct experiments to compare it with PrePost and FP-growth∗, two state-of-the-art algorithms, on a variety of real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that \{FIN\} is high performance on both running time and memory usage. }

  abstract = {Abstract The frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) is an efficient data structure for association-rule mining without generation of candidate itemsets. It is used to compress a database into a tree structure which stores only large items. When data are modified, it, however, needs to process all transactions in a batch way. In the past, the prelarge-tree structure was proposed to incrementally mine association rules efficiently. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to maintain this structure when records in an original database are modified. The proposed maintenance algorithm is based on the pre-large concepts, which are defined by a lower support threshold and an upper support threshold. Due to the pruning properties of pre-large concepts, the proposed approach can reduce the rescan number of an original database when records are modified. It can thus obtain good execution performance for pre-large tree maintenance, especially when each time a small number of records are modified. Although experimental results show that the proposed prelarge-tree maintenance algorithm has good performance for handling modified records, the proposed algorithm needs to maintain nodes of pre-large items in the tree structure. This is the additional overhead, which is a trade-off between execution time and tree complexity. }

We devised a novel algorithm that takes advantage of the scarcity of samples in microarray data sets, allowing us to efficiently find disjunctive closed patterns. Our algorithm, Disclosed, mines disjunctive closed itemsets by exploring the search space in a depth-first, top-down manner. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm to execute such a task using real microarray gene expression data sets publicly available on the Internet. Our experiments revealed under what situations, the characteristics of a data set, our method obtain a good, bad or average performance. We also compared the performance of our method with the state of the art algorithms for finding disjunctive closed patterns and disjunctive minimal generators. We observed that our approach is two orders of magnitude more efficient, both in terms of time and memory. }

  abstract = {Abstract With the considerable growth of user-generated content, online reviews are becoming extremely valuable sources for mining customers’ opinions on products and services. However, most of the traditional opinion mining methods are coarse-grained and cannot understand natural languages. Thus, aspect-based opinion mining and summarization are of great interest in academic and industrial research. In this paper, we study an approach to extract product and service aspect words, as well as sentiment words, automatically from reviews. An unsupervised dependency analysis-based approach is presented to extract Appraisal Expression Patterns (AEPs) from reviews, which represent the manner in which people express opinions regarding products or services and can be regarded as a condensed representation of the syntactic relationship between aspect and sentiment words. \{AEPs\} are high-level, domain-independent types of information, and have excellent domain adaptability. An AEP-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AEP-LDA) model is also proposed. This is a sentence-level, probabilistic generative model which assumes that all words in a sentence are drawn from one topic – a generally true assumption, based on our observation. The model also assumes that every review corpus is composed of several mutually corresponding aspect and sentiment topics, as well as a background word topic. The \{AEP\} information is incorporated into the AEP-LDA model for mining aspect and sentiment words simultaneously. The experimental results on reviews of restaurants, hotels, \{MP3\} players, and cameras show that the AEP-LDA model outperforms other approaches in identifying aspect and sentiment words. }

These questions were used to determine the current state of the art in this particular strand of \{TM\} and suggest future directions in \{TM\} development to support cancer research. Methods A review of the research on \{TM\} of cancer-related information was carried out. A literature search was conducted on the Medline database as well as \{IEEE\} Xplore and \{ACM\} digital libraries to address the interdisciplinary nature of such research. The search results were supplemented with the literature identified through Google Scholar. Results A range of studies have proven the feasibility of \{TM\} for extracting structured information from clinical narratives such as those found in pathology or radiology reports. In this article, we provide a critical overview of the current state of the art for \{TM\} related to cancer. The review highlighted a strong bias towards symbolic methods, e.g. named entity recognition (NER) based on dictionary lookup and information extraction (IE) relying on pattern matching. The F-measure of \{NER\} ranges between 80% and 90%, while that of \{IE\} for simple tasks is in the high 90s. To further improve the performance, \{TM\} approaches need to deal effectively with idiosyncrasies of the clinical sublanguage such as non-standard abbreviations as well as a high degree of spelling and grammatical errors. This requires a shift from rule-based methods to machine learning following the success of similar trends in biological applications of TM. Machine learning approaches require large training datasets, but clinical narratives are not readily available for \{TM\} research due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. This issue remains the main bottleneck for progress in this area. In addition, there is a need for a comprehensive cancer ontology that would enable semantic representation of textual information found in narrative reports. }

Methods The strategic tree algorithm was used to identify the main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health. The backpropogation artificial neural network was used to analyze the main manifestations of sub-healthy mental states of three different degrees. A sub-mental health evaluation model was then established to achieve predictive evaluation results. Results Using classifications from the Scale of Chinese Sub-healthy State, the main manifestations of sub-mental health selected using the strategic tree were \{F1101\} (Do you lack peace of mind?), \{F1102\} (Are you easily nervous when something comes up?), and \{F1002\} (Do you often sigh?). The relative intensity of manifestations of sub-mental health was highest for F1101, followed by F1102, and then F1002. Through study of the neural network, better differentiation could be made between moderate and severe and between mild and severe states of sub-mental health. The differentiation between mild and moderate sub-mental health states was less apparent. Additionally, the sub-mental health state evaluation model, which could be used to predict states of sub-mental health of different individuals, was established using F1101, F1102, F1002, and the mental self-assessment total score. Conclusions The main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health can be discovered using data mining methods to research and analyze the latent laws and knowledge hidden in research evidence on the state of sub-mental health. The state of sub-mental health of different individuals can be rapidly predicted using the model established here. This can provide a basis for assessment and intervention for sub-mental health. It can also replace the relatively outdated approaches to research on sub-health in the technical era of information and digitization by combining the study of states of sub-mental health with information techniques and by further quantifying the relevant information. }

On-shelf utility mining considers not only profits and quantities of items in transactions but also their on-shelf time periods in stores. Profit values of items in traditional on-shelf utility mining are considered as being positive. However, in real-world applications, items may be associated with negative profit values. This paper proposes an efficient three-scan mining approach to efficiently find high on-shelf utility itemsets with negative profit values from temporal databases. In particular, an effective itemset generation method is developed to avoid generating a large number of redundant candidates and to effectively reduce the number of data scans in mining. Experimental results for several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach has good performance in pruning effectiveness and execution efficiency. }

  abstract = {Abstract High utility itemset mining considers the importance of items such as profit and item quantities in transactions. Recently, mining high utility itemsets has emerged as one of the most significant research issues due to a huge range of real world applications such as retail market data analysis and stock market prediction. Although many relevant algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they incur the problem of generating a large number of candidate itemsets, which degrade mining performance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MU-Growth (Maximum Utility Growth) with two techniques for pruning candidates effectively in mining process. Moreover, we suggest a tree structure, named MIQ-Tree (Maximum Item Quantity Tree), which captures database information with a single-pass. The proposed data structure is restructured for reducing overestimated utilities. Performance evaluation shows that MU-Growth not only decreases the number of candidates but also outperforms state-of-the-art tree-based algorithms with overestimated methods in terms of runtime with a similar memory usage. }

Previous solutions addressing this concern add random noise to the raw data and/or encrypt the raw data with a substitution mapping. However, these solutions do not provide semantic security; partial information about raw data or mining results can be potentially discovered by an adversary at cloud servers under a reasonable assumption that the adversary knows some plaintext–ciphertext pairs. In this paper, we propose the first semantically secure solution for outsourcing association rule mining with both data privacy and mining privacy. In our solution, we assume that the data is categorical. Additionally, our solution is sound, which enables data owners to verify whether there exists any false data in the mining results returned by a cloud server. Experimental study shows that our solution is feasible and efficient. }

The extracted results of \{TOD\} are classified into three categories based on the types of product — existing, applied, and heterogeneous product. To illustrate the process and validate the utility of application, \{LED\} heat dissipation technology and \{LED\} lamps are selected as the technology and product for the illustration. The method contributes to suggest a semi-automated normative method for technology forecasting by combining morphology analysis and text mining. }

The goal of the studied problem is to mine and annotate a semantic relation with temporal, concise, and structured information, which can release the explicit, implicit, and diversity semantic relations between entities. The temporal semantic annotations can help users to learn and understand the unfamiliar or new emerged semantic relations between entities. The proposed temporal semantic annotation structure integrates the features from \{IEEE\} and Renlifang. We propose a general method to generate temporal semantic annotation of a semantic relation between entities by constructing its connection entities, lexical syntactic patterns, context sentences, context graph, and context communities. Empirical experiments on two different datasets including a LinkedIn dataset and movie star dataset show that the proposed method is effective and accurate. Different from the manually generated annotation repository such as Wikipedia and LinkedIn, the proposed method can automatically mine the semantic relation between entities and does not need any prior knowledge such as ontology or the hierarchical knowledge base. The proposed method can be used on some applications, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed temporal semantic relations on many web mining tasks. }

To fill these gaps, we have proposed a novel pattern mining algorithm to identify a set of contrast permission patterns that aim to detect the difference between clean and malicious applications. A benchmark malware dataset and a dataset of 1227 clean applications has been collected by us to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Valuable findings are obtained by analyzing the returned contrast permission patterns. }

A topic model is used to mine the interest distribution of users, which is then exploited to build the user–user similarity model and make travel recommendations. The season and weather context information is considered during the mining and the recommendation processes. Our method is evaluated on a Flickr dataset, which contains photos taken in 11 cities of China. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the precision of travel behavior prediction. }

  abstract = {AbstractBackground Digital traces left on the Internet by web users, if properly aggregated and analyzed, can represent a huge information dataset able to inform syndromic surveillance systems in real time with data collected directly from individuals. Since people use everyday language rather than medical jargon (e.g. runny nose vs. respiratory distress), knowledge of patients’ terminology is essential for the mining of health related conversations on social networks. Objectives In this paper we present a methodology for early detection and analysis of epidemics based on mining Twitter messages. In order to reliably trace messages of patients that actually complain of a disease, first, we learn a model of naïve medical language, second, we adopt a symptom-driven, rather than disease-driven, keyword analysis. This approach represents a major innovation compared to previous published work in the field. Method We first developed an algorithm to automatically learn a variety of expressions that people use to describe their health conditions, thus improving our ability to detect health-related “concepts” expressed in non-medical terms and, in the end, producing a larger body of evidence. We then implemented a Twitter monitoring instrument to finely analyze the presence and combinations of symptoms in tweets. Results We first evaluate the algorithm's performance on an available dataset of diverse medical condition synonyms, then, we assess its utility in a case study of five common syndromes for surveillance purposes. We show that, by exploiting physicians’ knowledge on symptoms positively or negatively related to a given disease, as well as the correspondence between patients’ “naïve” terminology and medical jargon, not only can we analyze large volumes of Twitter messages related to that disease, but we can also mine micro-blogs with complex queries, performing fine-grained tweets classification (e.g. those reporting influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms vs. common cold or allergy). Conclusions Our approach yields a very high level of correlation with flu trends derived from traditional surveillance systems. Compared with Google Flu, another popular tool based on query search volumes, our method is more flexible and less sensitive to changes in web search behaviors. }

Bottlenecks caused by mismatches in equipment sizes, combined with process fluctuations upon scale-up, can result in discarding expensive product. This paper describes a data mining decisional tool for rapid prediction of facility fit issues and debottlenecking of biomanufacturing facilities exposed to batch-to-batch variability and higher titres. The predictive tool comprised advanced multivariate analysis techniques to interrogate Monte Carlo stochastic simulation datasets that mimicked batch fluctuations in cell culture titres, step yields and chromatography eluate volumes. A decision tree classification method, \{CART\} (classification and regression tree) was introduced to explore the impact of these process fluctuations on product mass loss and reveal the root causes of bottlenecks. The resulting pictorial decision tree determined a series of if-then rules for the critical combinations of factors that lead to different mass loss levels. Three different debottlenecking strategies were investigated involving changes to equipment sizes, using higher capacity chromatography resins and elution buffer optimisation. The analysis compared the impact of each strategy on mass output, direct cost of goods per gram and processing time, as well as consideration of extra capital investment and space requirements. }

However, existing methods are inadequate because of dependencies on customers and physical prototypes. And there is lack of systems, focused on a problem identification process or an inter-technological comparison. In this research, to remedy existing limitations, analogy-based patent mining system is suggested. The system is developed based on an assumption that similar problems would occur in technologies that have similar properties or functions. So, the system is focused on identification of a Problem Solved Concept (PSC), which describes what problem is solved in the patent. At the first part of the system, the mature technology–a technology relatively matured than the new technology–is described with a property and a function; one of the property or the function should be similar to which of the new technology considered. And the system extract PSCs, construct patent map, and evaluate \{PSCs\} utilizing patents on the new and the mature technologies. As a result, the \{PSCs\} with high opportunities are revealed and patents related to the \{PSCs\} are examined. Then users of this system select some patents as resources for analogy. The system is tested by a case study of wireless charger technology. For the case study, 352 patents on wireless router technology and 227 patents on wireless charger technology are used. At the final, patents related to ‘handoff’, showed a high opportunity score and one of the patents is introduced to show the possibility of patent creation through analogy. }

Many researchers have mined the hierarchical association rules and thus proposed various approaches. However, some of the existing approaches produce many multilevel and cross-level association rules that fail to convey quality information. From these large number of redundant association rules, it is extremely difficult to extract any meaningful information. There also exist some approaches that mine minimal association rules, but these have many shortcomings due to their naïve-based approaches. In this paper, we have focused on the need for generating hierarchical minimal rules that provide maximal information. An algorithm has been proposed to derive minimal multilevel association rules and cross-level association rules. Our work has made significant contributions in mining the minimal cross-level association rules, which express the mixed relationship between the generalized and specialized view of the transaction itemsets. We are the first to design an efficient algorithm using a closed itemset lattice-based approach, which can mine the most relevant minimal cross-level association rules. The parent–child relationship of the lattices has been exploited while mining cross-level closed itemset lattices. We have extensively evaluated our proposed algorithm’s efficiency using a variety of real-life datasets and performing a large number of experiments. The proposed algorithm has outperformed the existing related work significantly during the pervasive performance comparison. }

  abstract = {Abstract Growing stock is an ecological indicator of forest ecosystem response to natural and anthropogenic impacts that may result from forest management measures or environmental impacts. Information on growing stock is thus essential to understand dynamics of forest stands, their productive capacity and to manage their use within limits of sustainability. Dynamic changes of forest growing stock, as well as predictions of their future development, are usually estimated from the data gathered by national forest inventories using some mechanistic modelling approach. The resulting models are informative, but include many parameters, some of which are difficult to set or estimate. Due to the demanding parameterisation of mechanistic models, it is hard to achieve stability of their output accuracy, which can lower their predictive power. This paper presents an alternative and complementary approach of constructing models with machine learning and data mining methods. We applied these methods to the Silva-SI database and used the resulting interpretable models in order to find explanations for structural changes in Slovenian forests over the period from year 1970 to 2010. In addition, we developed predictive models for growing sock in the decade from year 2010 to 2020. The structure of the models describing temporal dynamics of growing stock shows that trends of growing stock are increasing for the entire studied period, while accumulation of growing stock is much more intensive after 1990. Forests with a lower growing stock are located either in the areas with non-favorable site conditions for forest growth, or at lower altitudes, where they are more exposed to human exploitation due to their vicinity to more densely populated regions. Predictions of growing stock for the decade 2010–2020 suggest that Slovenian forests will continue to accumulate their growing stock (private owned forests to 327&#xa0;m3/ha and state owned forests to 343&#xa0;m3/ha in 2020). The presented data mining approach that was here applied to the growing stock can also be used for investigating other ecological indicators. }

  abstract = {Abstract Recently, there have been numerous efforts to fuse the latest Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology with the Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, in most cases these attempts are centered mainly on the simultaneous multiple reading capability of \{RFID\} technology, and thus neglect the management of massive data generated from the \{RFID\} reader. As a result, it is difficult to obtain flow information for \{RFID\} data mining related to real time process control. In this paper, we propose an advanced process management method, called ‘Procedure Tree’ (PT), for \{RFID\} data mining. Using the suggested PT, we are able to manage massive \{RFID\} data effectively, and perform real time process management efficiently. Then we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, after applying it to a real time process control system connected to the RFID-based EIS. For the verification of the suggested system, we collect an enormous amount of data in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) database, analyze characteristics of the collected data, and then compute the elapsed time on each stage in process control. The suggested system was able to perform what the traditional RFID-based process control systems failed to do, such as predicting and tracking of real time process and inventory control. }

In order to reduce this bottleneck, in this paper we propose a novel efficient algorithm to perform isomorphism testing of labeled graphs which in general performs less state-space tree searching. The proposed method uses graph signatures as the first-step filter, and it limits the backtracking occurring only between each pair of corresponding vertex classes, based on the proposed data structures and the vertex partition method. We compared the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods to verify its efficiency for several datasets each with different aspects of characteristics. The experimental results show that for irregular graphs, either labeled or unlabeled, the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in efficiency. For graphs with multiple labels but high regularity, the proposed method is still better than the compared methods. The result of this algorithm is directly applicable to those emerging applications related to graph-based data mining which need to perform isomorphism testing of labeled graphs in large databases. }

It is circulated and accumulated by knowledge flows (KFs) in the organization to support workers' task needs. Because workers accumulate knowledge of different domains, they may cooperate and participate in several task-based groups to satisfy their needs. In this paper, we propose algorithms that integrate information retrieval and data mining techniques to mine and construct group-based \{KFs\} (GKFs) for task-based groups. A \{GKF\} is expressed as a directed knowledge graph which represents the knowledge referencing behavior, or knowledge flow, of a group of workers with similar task needs. Task-related knowledge topics and their relationships (flows) can be identified from the knowledge graph so as to fulfill workers' task needs and promote knowledge sharing for collaboration of group members. Moreover, the frequent knowledge referencing path can be identified from the knowledge graph to indicate the frequent knowledge flow of the workers. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, we implement a prototype of the \{GKF\} mining system. Our \{GKF\} mining methods can enhance organizational learning and facilitate knowledge management, sharing, and reuse in an environment where collaboration and teamwork are essential. }

For the external validity of these sentiment reports, i.e., the applicability of the results to target audiences, it is important to well analyze data of the context of user-generated content and their sample of authors. The literature lacks an analysis of external validity of sentiment mining reports and the sentiment mining field lacks an operationalization of external validity dimensions toward practically useful techniques. From a kernel theory, we identify multiple threats to sentiment mining external validity and study three of them empirically 1) a mismatch in demographics of the reviewers sample, 2) bias due to reviewers' incidental experiences, and 3) manipulation of reviews. The value of external validity threat identifying techniques is next examined in cases from Goodread.com. We conclude that demographic biases can be well detected by current techniques, although we have doubts regarding stylometric techniques for this purpose. We demonstrate the usefulness of event and manipulation bias detection techniques in our cases, but this result needs further replications in more complex and more competitive contexts. Finally, for increasing the decisional usefulness of sentiment mining reports, they should be accompanied by external validity reports and software and service providers in this field should incorporate these in their offerings. }

Four main sectors of the industry are studied: oil/petrochemicals, bulk/specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products. Our study reveals that the top sustainability focuses of the four sectors are very similar: health and safety, human rights, reducing GHG, conserving energy/energy efficiency, and community investment. Sector-specific sustainability issues have also been identified, for example oil spill prevention in the oil/petrochemicals sector and access to medicine in the pharmaceuticals sector. Environment is identified to be the predominant sustainability aspect in the process industries. The text mining methodology, results, and findings are detailed in the paper. }

  abstract = {Abstract Although the integration of engineering data within the framework of product data management systems has been successful in the recent years, the holistic analysis (from a systems engineering perspective) of multi-disciplinary data or data based on different representations and tools is still not realized in practice. At the same time, the application of advanced data mining techniques to complete designs is very promising and bears a high potential for synergy between different teams in the development process. In this paper, we propose shape mining as a framework to combine and analyze data from engineering design across different tools and disciplines. In the first part of the paper, we introduce unstructured surface meshes as meta-design representations that enable us to apply sensitivity analysis, design concept retrieval and learning as well as methods for interaction analysis to heterogeneous engineering design data. We propose a new measure of relevance to evaluate the utility of a design concept. In the second part of the paper, we apply the formal methods to passenger car design. We combine data from different representations, design tools and methods for a holistic analysis of the resulting shapes. We visualize sensitivities and sensitive cluster centers (after feature reduction) on the car shape. Furthermore, we are able to identify conceptual design rules using tree induction and to create interaction graphs that illustrate the interrelation between spatially decoupled surface areas. Shape data mining in this paper is studied for a multi-criteria aerodynamic problem, i.e. drag force and rear lift, however, the extension to quality criteria from different disciplines is straightforward as long as the meta-design representation is still applicable. }

Thus, as result of the selection and analysis of 240 \{EDM\} works, an \{EDM\} work profile was compiled to describe 222 \{EDM\} approaches and 18 tools. A profile of the \{EDM\} works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of \{EDM\} approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict \{EDM\} approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the \{EDM\} approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed \{EDM\} works, and provides an analysis of the \{EDM\} strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled. }

Most existing approaches adopt a token-based software representation and use sequential analysis for pattern mining of cloned codes. Due to the intrinsic limitations of such spatial space analysis, these methods have difficulties handling statement reordering, insertion and control replacement. Recently, graph-based models such as program dependent graph have been exploited to solve these issues. Although they can improve the performance in terms of accuracy, they introduce additional problems. Their computational complexity is very high and dramatically increases with the software size, thus limiting their applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern mining framework for cloned codes in software systems. It efficiently exploits software’s spatial space information as well as graph space information and thus can mine accurate patterns of cloned codes for software systems. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with other methods. }

The method is a hybrid of two existing methods; Self-Organizing Maps and Association Mining. We utilize Self-Organizing Maps as the initial step to reduce the search space, and then apply Association Mining in order to find association rules. We demonstrate that this procedure has a number of advantages compared to traditional Association Mining; it allows for handling numerical variables without a priori binning and is able to generate variable groups which act as “hotspots” for statistically significant associations. We showcase the method on infertility-related data from Danish military conscripts. The clinical data we analyzed contained both categorical type questionnaire data and continuous variables generated from biological measurements, including missing values. From this data set, we successfully generated a number of interesting association rules, which relate an observation with a specific consequence and the p-value for that finding. Additionally, we demonstrate that the method can be used on non-clinical data containing chemical–disease associations in order to find associations between different phenotypes, such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. }

Disjunctive emerging patterns are sets of features that are very frequent among samples of a target class, cases in a case–control study, for example, and are very rare among all other samples. We, for the very first time, demonstrate that this problem can be solved using minimal transversals in a hypergraph. We propose a new divide-and-conquer algorithm that enables us to efficiently compute disjunctive emerging patterns in parallel and distributed environments. We conducted experiments using real-world microarray gene expression datasets to assess the performance of our approach. Our results show that our approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art solution available in the literature. In this sense, we contribute to the area of bioinformatics and data mining by providing another useful alternative to identify patterns distinguishing samples with different class labels, such as those in case–control studies, for example. }

In this article, we identify the synergies of data mining and MADM. Synergies can be attained by integration of \{MADM\} techniques into data mining and vice versa. The primary goal of the paper is to show a wide range of interactions between these two fields from a new perspective with an example of the integrated approach in supplier clustering and ranking. The integrated approach includes cluster analysis as a data mining tool and Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and \{VIseKriterijumskao\} ptimizacija i \{KOmpromisno\} Resenje (VIKOR) as the two \{MADM\} tools. More precisely, the features for clustering were selected and weighted by \{SWARA\} method and suppliers are clustered using two-stage cluster analysis. In addition, \{VIKOR\} technique is used to rank the clusters from the best to the worst one. The proposed integrated approach is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. }

Nevertheless, tree diversity must be ensured to mine a representative pattern collection. In this paper, we performed an experimental comparison among different diversity generation procedures. We compare diversity generated by each procedure based on the amount of total, unique, and minimal patterns extracted from the induced tree for different minimal support thresholds. This comparison, together with an accuracy and abstention experiment, shows that Random Forest and Bagging generate the most diverse and accurate pattern collection. Additionally, we study the influence of data type in the results, finding that Random Forest is best for categorical data and Bagging for numerical data. Comparison includes most known diversity generation procedures and three new deterministic procedures introduced here. These deterministic procedures outperform existing deterministic method, but are still outperformed by random procedures. }

Nonetheless, it has many useful applications; e.g., opinion and sentiment analysis from social networks. Current stream mining algorithms are based on approximations. In earlier work, mining frequent items in a stream under the max-frequency measure proved to be effective for items. In this paper, we extended our work from items to itemsets. Firstly, an optimized incremental algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in a stream is presented. The algorithm maintains a very compact summary of the stream for selected itemsets. Secondly, we show that further compacting the summary is non-trivial. Thirdly, we establish a connection between the size of a summary and results from number theory. Fourthly, we report results of extensive experimentation, both of synthetic and real-world datasets, showing the efficiency of the algorithm both in terms of time and space. }

Contrary to cross-sectional or static data, this type of observations (also known as stream data, temporal data, longitudinal data or repeated measures) are more challenging as one has to incorporate data dependency in the clustering process. In this research we focus on clustering categorical sequences. The method proposed here combines model-based and heuristic clustering. In the first step, the categorical sequences are transformed by an extension of the hidden Markov model into a probabilistic space, where a symmetric Kullback–Leibler distance can operate. Then, in the second step, using hierarchical clustering on the matrix of distances, the sequences can be clustered. This paper illustrates the enormous potential of this type of hybrid approach using a synthetic data set as well as the well-known Microsoft dataset with website users search patterns and a survey on job career dynamics. }

The review reveals that \{HRM\} constitutes a noteworthy new domain of data mining research that is dominated by method- and technology-oriented work.

Topic models discover topics in the corpus, which represent real world concepts by frequently co-occurring words. Recently, researchers found topics to be effective tools for structuring various software artifacts, such as source code, requirements documents, and bug reports. This research also hypothesized that using topics to describe the evolution of software repositories could be useful for maintenance and understanding tasks. However, research has yet to determine whether these automatically discovered topic evolutions describe the evolution of source code in a way that is relevant or meaningful to project stakeholders, and thus it is not clear whether topic models are a suitable tool for this task. In this paper, we take a first step towards evaluating topic models in the analysis of software evolution by performing a detailed manual analysis on the source code histories of two well-known and well-documented systems, \{JHotDraw\} and jEdit. We define and compute various metrics on the discovered topic evolutions and manually investigate how and why the metrics evolve over time. We find that the large majority (87%–89%) of topic evolutions correspond well with actual code change activities by developers. We are thus encouraged to use topic models as tools for studying the evolution of a software system. }

Discovering Geographic Web Search Topics (G-WSTs) from a query log can support a variety of downstream web applications such as finding commonality between locations and profiling search engine users. However, the task of discovering G-WSTs is nontrivial, not only because of the diversity of the information in web search but also due to the sheer size of query log. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Scalable Geographic Web Search Topic Discovery (SG-WSTD), which contains highly scalable functionalities such as search session derivation, geographic information extraction and geographic web search topic discovery to discover G-WSTs from query log. Within SG-WSTD, two probabilistic topic models are proposed to discover G-WSTs from two complementary perspectives. The first one is the Discrete Search Topic Model (DSTM), which discovers G-WSTs that capture the commonalities between discrete locations. The second is the Regional Search Topic Model (RSTM), which focuses on a specific geographic region on the map and discovers G-WSTs that demonstrate geographic locality. Since query log is typically voluminous, we implement the functionalities in SG-WSTD based on the MapReduce paradigm to solve the efficiency bottleneck. We evaluate SG-WSTD against several strong baselines on a real-life query log from AOL. The proposed framework demonstrates significantly improved data interpretability, better prediction performance, higher topic distinctiveness and superior scalability in the experimentation. }

This setting occurs frequently (e.g., in mobile applications/systems) and is gaining momentum even in advanced computational settings where social networks are the main representative. Inspired by this problem, we propose (i) a specialized data structure called DSMatrix, which captures important data from dense graph streams onto the disk directly and (ii) stream mining algorithms that make use of such structure in order to mine frequent patterns effectively and efficiently. Experimental results clearly confirm the benefits of our approach. }

The social media contents shared by these users reveal potential shopping needs. Product recommender is not limited to just e-commerce sites, it can also be expanded to social media sites. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical user interest mining (Huim) approach for personalized products recommendation. The input of our approach consists of user-contributed photos and user generated content (UGC), which include user-annotated photo tags and the comments from others in a social site. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, we make full use of the visual information and \{UGC\} of its photos to mine user's interest. Second, we represent user interest by a topic distribution vector, and apply our proposed Huim to enhance interest-related topics. Third, we also represent each product by a topic distribution vector. Then, we measure the relevance of user and product in the topic space and determine the rank of each product for the user. We conduct a series of experiments on Flickr users and the products from Bing Shopping. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

  abstract = {Abstract This research studies the risk prediction of hospital readmissions using metaheuristic and data mining approaches. This is a critical issue in the U.S. healthcare system because a large percentage of preventable hospital readmissions derive from a low quality of care during patients’ stays in the hospital as well as poor arrangement of the discharge process. To reduce the number of hospital readmissions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched a readmission penalty program in which hospitals receive reduced reimbursement for high readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries. In the current practice, patient readmission risk is widely assessed by evaluating a \{LACE\} score including length of stay (L), acuity level of admission (A), comorbidity condition (C), and use of emergency rooms (E). However, the \{LACE\} threshold classifying high- and low-risk readmitted patients is set up by clinic practitioners based on specific circumstances and experiences. This research proposed various data mining approaches to identify the risk group of a particular patient, including neural network model, random forest (RF) algorithm, and the hybrid model of swarm intelligence heuristic and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed neural network algorithm, the \{RF\} and the \{SVM\} classifiers are used to model patients’ characteristics, such as their ages, insurance payers, medication risks, etc. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed models with previous research. Experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction \{SVM\} model with particle swarm parameter tuning outperforms other algorithms and achieves 78.4% on overall prediction accuracy, 97.3% on sensitivity. The high sensitivity shows its strength in correctly identifying readmitted patients. The outcome of this research will help reduce overall hospital readmission rates and allow hospitals to utilize their resources more efficiently to enhance interventions for high-risk patients. }

The activities of classification, association, and clustering in data mining are employed to achieve this purpose. The hybrid algorithm developed uses data mining (DM), evolution strategy (ES) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to search for the global optimal solution. For unconstrained optimization problems, data mining techniques are used to determine a smaller search region that contains the global solution. For constrained optimization problems, the data mining techniques are used to find the approximate feasible region or the feasible region with better objective values. Numerical examples demonstrate that this hybrid algorithm can effectively find the global optimal solutions for two benchmark test problems. }

Text mining techniques offer a reliable and efficient way to quantify many aspects of digital libraries, as well as methods to cluster and regroup digital content in relation to topical content. This chapter will discuss text preparation techniques in R, the use of the latent Dirichlet allocation to classify content, and the analysis of text features, like co-occurrence matrices. Simple similarity measures between authors and between papers will be used to illustrate cluster cohesion within the dataset. }

Machine learning and rule-based approaches both have a long history in biomedical natural language processing, and hybrid systems are common. Much progress has been made in biomedical natural language processing and text mining in recent years, and the field is poised for explosive growth as new resources should become available in the near future.

In the first method, query terms are added to relevant documents in the training of the latent Dirichlet allocation model. In the second method, the latent Dirichlet allocation model is expanded to deal with relevant query terms. The topic of each term within a given document may be sampled using either the normal document-specific mixture weights in \{LDA\} using query-specific mixture weights. We also developed an efficient method based on the Gibbs sampling technique for parameter estimation. Experiment results based on the Text \{REtrieval\} Conference Corpus (TREC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models. }

  abstract = {AbstractObjective Data in electronic health records (EHRs) is being increasingly leveraged for secondary uses, ranging from biomedical association studies to comparative effectiveness. To perform studies at scale and transfer knowledge from one institution to another in a meaningful way, we need to harmonize the phenotypes in such systems. Traditionally, this has been accomplished through expert specification of phenotypes via standardized terminologies, such as billing codes. However, this approach may be biased by the experience and expectations of the experts, as well as the vocabulary used to describe such patients. The goal of this work is to develop a data-driven strategy to (1) infer phenotypic topics within patient populations and (2) assess the degree to which such topics facilitate a mapping across populations in disparate healthcare systems. Methods We adapt a generative topic modeling strategy, based on latent Dirichlet allocation, to infer phenotypic topics. We utilize a variance analysis to assess the projection of a patient population from one healthcare system onto the topics learned from another system. The consistency of learned phenotypic topics was evaluated using (1) the similarity of topics, (2) the stability of a patient population across topics, and (3) the transferability of a topic across sites. We evaluated our approaches using four months of inpatient data from two geographically distinct healthcare systems: (1) Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) and (2) Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Results The method learned 25 phenotypic topics from each healthcare system. The average cosine similarity between matched topics across the two sites was 0.39, a remarkably high value given the very high dimensionality of the feature space. The average stability of \{VUMC\} and \{NMH\} patients across the topics of two sites was 0.988 and 0.812, respectively, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Also the \{VUMC\} and \{NMH\} topics have smaller variance of characterizing patient population of two sites than standard clinical terminologies (e.g., ICD9), suggesting they may be more reliably transferred across hospital systems. Conclusions Phenotypic topics learned from \{EHR\} data can be more stable and transferable than billing codes for characterizing the general status of a patient population. This suggests that EHR-based research may be able to leverage such phenotypic topics as variables when pooling patient populations in predictive models. }

  abstract = {In sentiment analysis, a finer-grained opinion mining method not only focuses on the view of the product itself, but also focuses on product features, which can be a component or attribute of the product. Previous related research mainly relied on explicit features but ignored implicit features. However, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are so significant that they can express the users’ opinion and help us to better understand the users’ comments. It is a big challenge to detect these implicit features in Chinese product reviews, due to the complexity of Chinese. This paper is mainly centered on implicit features identification in Chinese product reviews. A novel hybrid association rule mining method is proposed for this task. The core idea of this approach is mining as many association rules as possible via several complementary algorithms. Firstly, we extract candidate feature indicators based word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and feature clustering, then compute the co-occurrence degree between the candidate feature indicators and the feature words using five collocation extraction algorithms. Each indicator and the corresponding feature word constitute a rule (feature indicator → feature word). The best rules in five different rule sets are chosen as the basic rules. Next, three methods are proposed to mine some possible reasonable rules from the lower co-occurrence feature indicators and non indicator words. Finally, the latest rules are used to identify implicit features and the results are compared with the previous. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approach is competent at the task, especially via using several expanding methods. The recall is effectively improved, suggesting that the shortcomings of the basic rules have been overcome to certain extent. Besides those high co-occurrence degree indicators, the final rules also contain uncommon rules. }

With the appearance of large textual corpora in the recent years, we felt the need to integrate modules for information extraction in the existing information retrieval systems. The processing of large textual corpora leads needs that are situated at the border of information extraction and information retrieval areas. Our work in this paper, focus on the extraction of the surface information, i.e. information that not requires complex linguistic processing to be categorized. The goal is to detect and extract passages or sequences of words containing relevant information from the prophetic narrations texts. We propose Finite state transducers-based system that solves successively the problem of texts comprehension. Experimental evaluation results demonstrated that our approach is feasible. Our system achieved encouraging precision and recall rates, the overall precision and recall are 71% and 39% respectively. }

  abstract = {Abstract Objective-oriented association (OOA) mining has been successfully applied in malware detection. One problem of \{OOA\} mining is that the number of association rules is very large, and many of the rules are redundant and have little capacity to distinguish malware from benign files. This circumstance seriously affects the running speed of \{OOA\} for malware detection. In this paper, an \{API\} (Application Programming Interface)-based association mining method is proposed for detecting malware. To increase the detection speed of the OOA, different strategies are presented: to improve the rule quality, criteria for \{API\} selection are proposed to remove \{APIs\} that cannot become frequent items; to find association rules that have strong discrimination power, we define the rule utility to evaluate the association rules; and to improve the detection accuracy, a classification method based on multiple association rules is adopted. The experiments show that the proposed strategies can significantly improve the running speed of OOA. In our experiments the time cost for data mining is reduced by thirty-two percent, and the time cost for classification is reduced by fifty percent. }

In 2011, we generated a dataset from the legal statements (mainly privacy policy and terms of use) on the websites of 475 of the \{US\} Fortune 500 Companies and used it as input to see what we could detect about the organizational relationships between the companies by using a textual data mining tool. We hoped to find that the tool would cluster similar corporations into the same industrial sector, as validated by the company's self-reported North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS). Unfortunately, this proved only marginally successful, leading us to ask why and to pose our research question: What problems occur when a data-mining tool is used to analyze large textual datasets that are unstructured, complex, duplicative, and contain many homonyms and synonyms? In analyzing our large dataset we learned a great deal about the problem and fortunately, after significant effort, determined how to “massage” the raw dataset to improve the process and learn how the tool can be better used in research situations. We also found that NAICS, as self-reported by companies, are of dubious value to a researcher—a matter briefly discussed. }

Using a bibliometric approach, this paper analyzes \{KM\} and \{DM\} research trends, forecasts and citations from 1989 to 2009 by locating headings “knowledge management” and “data mining” in topics in the \{SSCI\} database. The bibliometric analytical technique was used to examine these two topics in \{SSCI\} journals from 1989 to 2009, we found 1393 articles with \{KM\} and 1181 articles with DM. This paper implemented and classified \{KM\} and \{DM\} articles using the following eight categories—publication year, citation, country/territory, document type, institute name, language, source title and subject area—for different distribution status in order to explore the differences and how \{KM\} and \{DM\} technologies have developed in this period and to analyze \{KM\} and \{DM\} technology tendencies under the above result. Also, the paper performs the K–S test to check whether the distribution of author article production follows Lotka’s law. The research findings can be extended to investigate author productivity by analyzing variables such as chronological and academic age, number and frequency of previous publications, access to research grants, job status, etc. In such a way characteristics of high, medium and low publishing activity of authors can be identified. Besides, these findings will also help to judge scientific research trends and understand the scale of development of research in \{KM\} and \{DM\} through comparing the increases of the article author. Based on the above information, governments and enterprises may infer collective tendencies and demands for scientific researcher in \{KM\} and \{DM\} to formulate appropriate training strategies and policies in the future. This analysis provides a roadmap for future research, abstracts technology trend information and facilitates knowledge accumulations, therefore the future research can concentrated in core categories. This implies that the phenomenon “success breeds success” is more common in higher quality publications. }

Besides, organizations want to concentrate on their own business and outsource the rest of their work. This approach is named “database as a service concept” and provides lots of benefits to data owner, but, at the same time, brings out some security problems.

Case-based Reasoning (CBR) solves problems using the already stored knowledge, and captures new knowledge, making it immediately available for solving the next problem. Therefore, case-based reasoning can be seen as a method for problem solving, and also as a method to capture new experience and make it immediately available for problem solving. Therefore, \{CBR\} can mine sparse and big data. It can be seen as a learning and knowledge-discovery approach, since it can capture from new experience some general knowledge, such as case classes, prototypes and some higher-level concept. In this talk, we will explain the case-based reasoning process scheme. We will show what kinds of methods are necessary to provide all the functions for such a computer model. We will develop the bridge between \{CBR\} and Statistics and show how case- based reasoning can mine big and sparse data. Examples are being given based on multimedia applications. Finally, we will show recent new developments and we will give an outline for further work. }

To make access to the vastly increasing resource of blogs more effective, clustering is useful. Results of the literature review suggest that using linking information, keywords, or tags/categories to calculate similarity is critical for clustering. Keywords are commonly retrieved from the full text, which can be a time-consuming task if multiple articles must be processed. For tags/categories, there is also a problem of ambiguity; that is, different bloggers may define tags/categories of identical content differently. Keywords are important not only to reflect the theme of an article through blog readers’ perspectives but also to accurately match users’ intentions. In this paper, a tracing code is embedded in Blog Connect, a newly developed platform, to collect the keywords queried by readers and then select candidate keywords as co-keywords. The experiments show positive data to confirm that co-keywords can act as a quick path to an article. In addition, co-keyword generation can reduce the complexity and redundancy of full-text keyword retrieval procedures and satisfy blog readers’ intentions. }

It adapts and combines several existing approaches from literature: approaches that extract new technological ideas from a user given text, approaches that investigate the different idea characteristics in different technical domains, and multi-language web mining approaches. In contrast to previous work, the proposed approach enables the identification of problem solution ideas in the internet considering domain dependencies and language aspects. In a case study, new ideas are identified to solve existing technological problems as occurred in research and development (R&amp;D) projects.

A large volume of information is generated by online users and how to appropriately provide personalized content is becoming more challenging. Traditional recommendation models are overly dependent on preference ratings and often suffer from the problem of “data sparsity”. Recent research has attempted to integrate sentiment analysis results of online affective texts into recommendation models; however, these studies are still limited. The one class collaborative filtering (OCCF) method is more applicable in the social media scenario yet it is insufficient for item recommendation. In this study, we develop a novel sentiment-aware social media recommendation framework, referred to as SA_OCCF, in order to tackle the above challenges. We leverage inferred sentiment feedback information and \{OCCF\} models to improve recommendation performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a real social media web site to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in improving the performance of the baseline \{OCCF\} methods. }

Finding frequent itemsets is one of the most important tasks in data stream mining with wide applications like online e-business and web click-stream analysis. However, two main problems existed in relevant studies: (1) The utilities (e.g., importance or profits) of items are not considered. Actual utilities of patterns cannot be reflected in frequent itemsets. (2) Existing utility mining methods produce too many patterns and this makes it difficult for the users to filter useful patterns among the huge set of patterns. In view of this, in this paper we propose a novel framework, named \{GUIDE\} (Generation of maximal high Utility Itemsets from Data strEams), to find maximal high utility itemsets from data streams with different models, i.e., landmark, sliding window and time fading models. The proposed structure, named MUI-Tree (Maximal high Utility Itemset Tree), maintains essential information for the mining processes and the proposed strategies further facilitates the performance of GUIDE. Main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on mining the compact form of high utility patterns from data streams; (2) \{GUIDE\} is an effective one-pass framework which meets the requirements of data stream mining; (3) \{GUIDE\} generates novel patterns which are not only high utility but also maximal, which provide compact and insightful hidden information in the data streams. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms under various conditions in data stream environments on different models. }

A part of this technique aims to analyze the behavior of users in order to continuously improve both the structure and content of visited web sites. Behind this quite altruistic belief – namely, to help the user feel comfortable when they visit a site through a personalization process – there underlie a series of processing methodologies which operate at least arguably from the point of view of the users’ privacy. Thus, an important question arises; to what extent may the desire to improve the services offered through a web site infringe upon the privacy of those who visit it? The use of powerful processing tools such as those provided by web mining may threaten users’ privacy. Current legal scholarship on privacy issues suggests a flexible approach that enables the determination, within each particular context, of those behaviors that can threaten individual privacy. However, it has been observed that \{TIC\} professionals, with the purpose of formulating practical rules on this matter, have a very narrow-minded concept of privacy, primarily centered on the dichotomy between personal identifiable information (PII) and anonymous data. The aim of this paper is to adopt an integrative approach based on the distinctive attributes of web mining in order to determine which techniques and uses are harmful. }

In order to enhance store layout, generate customers groups, offers and personalized recommendations, among others. To accomplish these objectives, it is very important to know which products are related to each other. Classical approaches for clustering products, such as K-means or SOFM, do not work when exist scattered and large amounts of data. Even association rules give results that are difficult to interpret. These facts motivate us to use a novel approach that generates communities of products. One of the main advantages of these communities is that are meaningful and easily interpretable by retail analysts. This approach allows the processing of billions of transaction records within a reasonable time, according to the needs of companies. }

Methods Chinese medicine recipes for fuming-washing therapy for \{KOA\} were collected and recorded in a database. The correlation coefficient among herbs, core combinations of herbs, and new prescriptions were analyzed using modified mutual information, complex system entropy cluster, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering, respectively. Results Based on analysis of 345 Chinese medicine recipes for fuming-washing therapy, 68 herbs occurred frequently, 33 herb pairs occurred frequently, and 12 core combinations were found. Five new fuming-washing recipes for \{KOA\} were developed. Conclusion Chinese medicines for fuming-washing therapy of \{KOA\} mainly consist of wind-dampness-dispelling and cold-dispersing herbs, blood-activating and stasis-resolving herbs, and wind-dampness-dispelling and heat-clearing herbs. The treatment of fuming-washing therapy for \{KOA\} also includes dispelling wind-dampness and dispersing cold, activating blood and resolving stasis, and dispelling wind-dampness and clearing heat. Zhenzhutougucao (Herba Speranskiae Tuberculatae), Honghua (Flos Carthami), Niuxi (Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae), Shenjincao (Herba Lycopodii Japonici), Weilingxian (Radix et Rhizoma Clematidis Chinensis), Chuanwu (Radix Aconiti), Haitongpi (Cortex Erythrinae Variegatae), Ruxiang (Olibanum), Danggui (Radix Angelicae Sinensis), Caowu (Radix Aconiti Kusnezoffii), Moyao (Myrrha), and Aiye (Folium Artemisiae Argyi) are the main herbs used in the fuming-washing treatment for KOA. }

The bibliometric analytical technique was used to examine the topic in \{SSCI\} journals from 1989 to 2009, we found 1181 articles with data mining. This paper implemented and classified data mining articles using the following eight categories—publication year, citation, country/territory, document type, institute name, language, source title and subject area—for different distribution status in order to explore the differences and how data mining technologies have developed in this period and to analyze technology tendencies and forecasts of data mining under the above results. Also, the paper performs the K-S test to check whether the analysis follows Lotka’s law. Besides, the analysis also reviews the historical literatures to come out technology diffusions of data mining. The paper provides a roadmap for future research, abstracts technology trends and forecasts, and facilitates knowledge accumulation so that data mining researchers can save some time since core knowledge will be concentrated in core categories. This implies that the phenomenon “success breeds success” is more common in higher quality publications. }

Literature shows that weak signals can be found in the organization’s environment and that they appear in different contexts. We use internet information to represent organization’s environment and we select these websites that are related to a given hypothesis. In contrast to related research, a methodology is provided that uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) for the identification of weak signals. This improves existing knowledge based approaches because \{LSI\} considers the aspects of meaning and thus, it is able to identify similar textual patterns in different contexts. A new weak signal maximization approach is introduced that replaces the commonly used prediction modeling approach in LSI. It enables to calculate the largest number of relevant weak signals represented by singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensions. A case study identifies and analyses weak signals to predict trends in the field of on-site medical oxygen production. This supports the planning of research and development (R&amp;D) for a medical oxygen supplier. As a result, it is shown that the proposed methodology enables organizations to identify weak signals from the internet for a given hypothesis. This helps strategic planners to react ahead of time. }

In fact knowledge obtained from social networks such as Twitter and Facebook has been shown to be extremely valuable to marketing research companies, public opinion organizations and other text mining entities. However, Web texts have been classified as noisy as they represent considerable problems both at the lexical and the syntactic levels. In this research we used a random sample of 3516 tweets to evaluate consumers’ sentiment towards well-known brands such as Nokia, T-Mobile, IBM, \{KLM\} and DHL. We used an expert-predefined lexicon including around 6800 seed adjectives with known orientation to conduct the analysis. Our results indicate a generally positive consumer sentiment towards several famous brands. By using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology to analyze brands’ tweets, this study adds breadth and depth to the debate over attitudes towards cosmopolitan brands. }

There have been an enormous number of publications on cancer research. This integrated but unstructured biomedical text is of great value for cancer diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. The immense body and rapid growth of biomedical text on cancer has led to the appearance of a large number of text mining techniques aimed at extracting novel knowledge from scientific text. Biomedical text mining on cancer research is computationally automatic and high-throughput in nature. However, it is error-prone due to the complexity of natural language processing. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts underlying text mining and examine some frequently used algorithms, tools, and data sets, as well as assessing how much these algorithms have been utilized. We then discuss the current state-of-the-art text mining applications in cancer research and we also provide some resources for cancer text mining. With the development of systems biology, researchers tend to understand complex biomedical systems from a systems biology viewpoint. Thus, the full utilization of text mining to facilitate cancer systems biology research is fast becoming a major concern. To address this issue, we describe the general workflow of text mining in cancer systems biology and each phase of the workflow. We hope that this review can (i) provide a useful overview of the current work of this field; (ii) help researchers to choose text mining tools and datasets; and (iii) highlight how to apply text mining to assist cancer systems biology research. }

This paper describes in detail a method for semi-automatic discovery of relevant information characterizing Knowledge-Intensive Processes, as well as the results of further evaluation of the method. Our approach draws on the informal exchange of existing knowledge in collaborative tools such as e-mails. The output is a conceptual map that describes the main elements of a Knowledge-Intensive Process, as well as their relationships.

  abstract = {Abstract Pathogen incidence rate prediction, which can be considered as time series modeling, is an important task for infectious disease incidence rate prediction and for public health. This paper investigates the application of a genetic computation technique, namely GEP, for pathogen incidence rate prediction. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional sliding windows in GEP-based time series modeling, the paper introduces the problem of mining effective sliding window, for discovering optimal sliding windows for building accurate prediction models. To utilize the periodical characteristic of pathogen incidence rates, a multi-segment sliding window consisting of several segments from different periodical intervals is proposed and used. Since the number of such candidate windows is still very large, a heuristic method is designed for enumerating the candidate effective multi-segment sliding windows. Moreover, methods to find the optimal sliding window and then produce a mathematical model based on that window are proposed. A performance study on real-world datasets shows that the techniques are effective and efficient for pathogen incidence rate prediction. }

  abstract = {Association-rule mining, which is based on frequency values of items, is the most common topic in data mining. In real-world applications, customers may, however, buy many copies of products and each product may have different factors, such as profits and prices. Only mining frequent itemsets in binary databases is thus not suitable for some applications. Utility mining is thus presented to consider additional measures, such as profits or costs according to user preference. In the past, a two-phase mining algorithm was designed for fast discovering high utility itemsets from databases. When data come intermittently, the approach needs to process all the transactions in a batch way. In this paper, an incremental mining algorithm for efficiently mining high utility itemsets is proposed to handle the above situation. It is based on the concept of the fast-update (FUP) approach, which was originally designed for association mining. The proposed approach first partitions itemsets into four parts according to whether they are high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in the original database and in the newly inserted transactions. Each part is then executed by its own procedure. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm executes faster than the two-phase batch mining algorithm in the intermittent data environment }

Most social networks such as Epinions and Facebook allow users to declare trusts or friendships with other users. Some of them also allow users to declare distrusts or negative relationships. When both positive and negative links co-exist in a network, some interesting community structures can be studied. In this work, we mine Direct Antagonistic Communities (DACs) within such signed networks. Each \{DAC\} consists of two sub-communities with positive relationships among members of each sub-community, and negative relationships among members of the other sub-community. Identifying direct antagonistic communities is an important step to understand the nature of the formation, dissolution, and evolution of such communities. Knowledge about antagonistic communities allows us to better understand and explain behaviors of users in the communities. Identifying \{DACs\} from a large signed network is however challenging as various combinations of user sets, which is very large in number, need to be checked. We propose an efficient data mining solution that leverages the properties of DACs, and combines the identification of strongest connected components and bi-clique mining. We have experimented our approach on synthetic, myGamma, and Epinions datasets to showcase the efficiency and utility of our proposed approach. We show that we can mine \{DACs\} in less than 15&#xa0;min from a signed network of myGamma, which is a mobile social networking site, consisting of 600,000 members and 8&#xa0;million links. An investigation on the behavior of users participating in \{DACs\} shows that antagonism significantly affects the way people behave and interact with one another. }

Data has been collected over a full academic year in three typical classrooms. Data association mining, a powerful data mining tool, is applied to the data in order to extract association rules and explore lighting waste patterns. The simulations results show that if the waste patterns are avoided, significant savings, as high as 70% of the current energy use, are achievable. }

More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers.

To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors’ social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza.

  abstract = {Abstract Subgraph mining is the process of identifying concepts describing interesting and repetitive subgraphs within graph-based data. The exponential number of possible subgraphs makes the problem very challenging. Existing methods apply a single-objective subgraph search with the view that interesting subgraphs are those capable of not merely compressing the data, but also enhancing the interpretation of the data considerably. Usually the methods operate by posing simple constraints (or user-defined thresholds) such as returning all subgraphs whose frequency is above a specified threshold. Such search approach may often return either a large number of solutions in the case of a weakly defined objective or very few in the case of a very strictly defined objective. In this paper, we propose a framework based on multiobjective evolutionary programming to mine subgraphs by jointly maximizing two objectives, support and size of the extracted subgraphs. The proposed methodology is able to discover a nondominated set of interesting subgraphs subject to tradeoff between the two objectives, which otherwise would not be achieved by the single-objective search. Besides, it can use different specific multiobjective evolutionary programming methods. Experimental results obtained by three of the latter methods on synthetically generated as well as real-life graph-based datasets validate the utility of the proposed methodology when benchmarked against classical single-objective methods and their previous, nonevolutionary multiobjective extensions. }

  abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes demographic estimation algorithms for profiling Twitter users, based on their tweets and community relationships. Many people post their opinions via social media services such as Twitter. This huge volume of opinions, expressed in real time, has great appeal as a novel marketing application. When automatically extracting these opinions, it is desirable to be able to discriminate discrimination based on user demographics, because the ratio of positive and negative opinions differs depending on demographics such as age, gender, and residence area, all of which are essential for market analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid text-based and community-based method for the demographic estimation of Twitter users, where these demographics are estimated by tracking the tweet history and clustering of followers/followees. Our experimental results from 100,000 Twitter users show that the proposed hybrid method improves the accuracy of the text-based method. The proposed method is applicable to various user demographics and is suitable even for users who only tweet infrequently. }

While traditional methods for automatic detection of plagiarism compute the similarity measures on a document-to-document basis, this is not always possible since the potential source documents are not always available. We do text mining, exploring the use of words as a linguistic feature for analyzing a document by modeling the writing style present in it. The main goal is to discover deviations in the style, looking for segments of the document that could have been written by another person. This can be considered as a classification problem using self-based information where paragraphs with significant deviations in style are treated as outliers. This so-called intrinsic plagiarism detection approach does not need comparison against possible sources at all, and our model relies only on the use of words, so it is not language specific. We demonstrate that this feature shows promise in this area, achieving reasonable results compared to benchmark models. }

Composite e-services, which consist of various e-services provided by different e-service providers, are complex processes that require the cooperation among cross-organizational e-service providers. The flexibility and success of e-business depend on effective knowledge support to access related information resources of composite e-services. Thus, providing effective knowledge support for accessing composite e-services is a challenging task. This work proposes a knowledge map platform to provide an effective knowledge support for utilizing composite e-services. A data mining approach is applied to extract knowledge patterns from the usage records of composite e-services. Based on the mining result, topic maps are employed to construct the knowledge map. Meanwhile, the proposed knowledge map is integrated with recommendation capability to generate recommendations for composite e-services via data mining and collaborative filtering techniques. A prototype system is implemented to demonstrate the proposed platform. The proposed knowledge map enhanced with recommendation capability can provide users customized decision support to effectively utilize composite e-services. }

Here, the aim of knowledge discovery using text mining (KDT) task is to discover the best-practice repair knowledge from millions of repair verbatim enabling accurate FD. However, the complexity of \{KDT\} problem is largely due to the fact that a significant amount of relevant knowledge is buried in noisy and unstructured verbatim. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology-based text mining system, which uses the diagnosis ontology for annotating key terms recorded in the repair verbatim. The annotated terms are extracted in different tuples, which are used to identify the field anomalies. The extracted tuples are further used by the frequently co-occurring clustering algorithm to cluster the repair verbatim data such that the best-practice repair actions used to fix commonly observed symptoms associated with the faulty parts can be discovered. The performance of our system has been validated by using the real world data and it has been successfully implemented in a web based distributed architecture in real life industry. }

  abstract = {Abstract In the context of role-based access control (RBAC), mining approaches, such as role mining or organizational mining, can be applied to derive permissions and roles from a system's configuration or from log files. In this way, mining techniques document the current state of a system and produce current-state \{RBAC\} models. However, such current-state \{RBAC\} models most often follow from structures that have evolved over time and are not the result of a systematic rights management procedure. In contrast, role engineering is applied to define a tailored \{RBAC\} model for a particular organization or information system. Thus, role engineering techniques produce a target-state \{RBAC\} model that is customized for the business processes supported via the respective information system. The migration from a current-state \{RBAC\} model to a tailored target-state \{RBAC\} model is, however, a complex task. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to migrate current-state \{RBAC\} models to target-state \{RBAC\} models. In particular, we use model comparison techniques to identify differences between two \{RBAC\} models. Based on these differences, we derive migration rules that define which elements and element relations must be changed, added, or removed. A migration guide then includes all migration rules that need to be applied to a particular current-state \{RBAC\} model to produce the corresponding target-state \{RBAC\} model. We conducted two comparative studies to identify which visualization technique is most suitable to make migration guides available to human users. Based on the results of these comparative studies, we implemented tool support for the derivation and visualization of migration guides. Our software tool is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Moreover, this paper describes the experimental evaluation of our tool. }

The faster message and ease of use in social media today is Twitter. The messages on Twitter include reviews and opinions on certain topics such as movie, book, product, politic, and so on. Based on this condition, this research attempts to use the messages of twitter to review a movie by using opinion mining or sentiment analysis. Opinion mining refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text mining to identify or classify whether the movie is good or not based on message opinion. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is supervised learning methods that analyze data and recognize the patterns that are used for classification. This research concerns on binary classification which is classified into two classes. Those classes are positive and negative. The positive class shows good message opinion; otherwise the negative class shows the bad message opinion of certain movies. This justification is based on the accuracy level of \{SVM\} with the validation process uses 10-Fold cross validation and confusion matrix. The hybrid Partical Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to improve the election of best parameter in order to solve the dual optimization problem. The result shows the improvement of accuracy level from 71.87% to 77%. }

In particular, the use of role mining techniques for the discovery of roles from previously deployed authorizations has facilitated the configuration of such frameworks. However, the literature lacks from a clear basis for appraising and leveraging the learning outcomes of the role mining process. In this paper, we provide such a formal basis. We compare sets of roles by projecting roles from one set into the other set. This approach is useful to measure how comparable the two configurations of roles are, and to interpret each role. We formally define the problem of comparing sets of roles, and prove that the problem is NP-complete. Then, we propose an algorithm to map the inherent relationship between the sets based on Boolean expressions. We demonstrate the correctness and completeness of our solution, and investigate some further issues that may benefit from our approach, such as detection of unhandled perturbations or source misconfiguration. In particular, we emphasize that the presence of shadowed roles in the role configuration increases the time complexity of sets of roles comparison. We provide a definition of the shadowed roles problem and propose a solution that detects different cases of role shadowing. }

The study found the discrepancies as well as similarities in the students’ patterns and themes of participation between online questions (student–instructor interaction) and online chat messages (student–students interaction or peer interaction). The results also identify disciplinary differences in students’ online participation. A correlation is found between the number of online questions students asked and students’ final grades.

The discovered frequent patterns are called constrained frequent \{U2\} patterns (where “U2” represents “univariate uncertain”). In univariate uncertain data, each attribute in a transaction is associated with a quantitative interval and a probability density function. The CUP-Miner algorithm is implemented in two phases: In the first phase, a U2P-tree (Univariate Uncertain Pattern tree) is constructed by compressing the target database transactions into a compact tree structure. Then, in the second phase, the constrained frequent \{U2\} pattern is enumerated by traversing the U2P-tree with different strategies that correspond to different types of constraints. The algorithm speeds up the mining process by exploiting five constraint properties: succinctness, anti-monotonicity, monotonicity, convertible anti-monotonicity, and convertible monotonicity. Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP-Miner outperforms the modified \{CAP\} algorithm, the modified \{FIC\} algorithm, the modified U2P-Miner algorithm, and the modified Apriori algorithm. }

This study applies methods of data mining (decision tree and association rules) to the Finnish national occupational accidents and diseases statistics database to analyse factors related to slipping, stumbling, and falling (SSF) accidents at work from 2006 to 2007. \{SSF\} accidents at work constitute a large proportion (22%) of all accidents at work in Finland. In addition, they are more likely to result in longer periods of incapacity for work than other workplace accidents. The most important factor influencing whether or not an accident at work is related to \{SSF\} is the specific physical activity of movement. In addition, the risk of \{SSF\} accidents at work seems to depend on the occupation and the age of the worker. The results were in line with previous research. Hence the application of data mining methods was considered successful. The results did not reveal anything unexpected though. Nevertheless, because of the capability to illustrate a large dataset and relationships between variables easily, data mining methods were seen as a useful supplementary method in analysing occupational accident data. }

  abstract = {Many \{CBR\} systems have been developed in the past. However, currently many \{CBR\} systems are facing a sustainability issue such as outdated cases and stagnant case growth. Some \{CBR\} systems have fallen into disuse due to the lack of new cases, case update, user participation and user engagement. To encourage the use of \{CBR\} systems and give users better experience, \{CBR\} system developers need to come up with new ways to add new features and values to the \{CBR\} systems. The author proposes a framework to use text mining and Web 2.0 technologies to improve and enhance \{CBR\} systems for providing better user experience. Two case studies were conducted to evaluate the usefulness of text mining techniques and Web 2.0 technologies for enhancing a large scale \{CBR\} system. The results suggest that text mining and Web 2.0 are promising ways to bring additional values to \{CBR\} and they should be incorporated into the \{CBR\} design and development process for the benefit of \{CBR\} users. }

  abstract = {Abstract Periodic pattern mining in time series databases is one of the most interesting data mining problems that is frequently appeared in many real-life applications. Some of the existing approaches find fixed length periodic patterns by using suffix tree structure, i.e., unable to mine flexible patterns. One of the existing approaches generates periodic patterns by skipping intermediate events, i.e., flexible patterns, using apriori based sequential pattern mining approach. Since, apriori based approaches suffer from the issues of huge amount of candidate generation and large percentage of false pattern pruning, we propose an efficient algorithm \{FPPM\} (Flexible Periodic Pattern Mining) using suffix trie data structure. The proposed algorithm can capture more effective variable length flexible periodic patterns by neglecting unimportant or undesired events and considering only the important events in an efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that simultaneously handles various starting position throughout the sequences, flexibility among events in the mined patterns and interactive tuning of period values on the go. Complexity analysis of the proposed approach and comparison with existing approaches along with analytical comparison on various issues have been performed. As well as extensive experimental analyses are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed \{FPPM\} algorithm using real-life datasets. The proposed approach outperforms existing algorithms in terms of processing time, scalability, and quality of mined patterns. }

The volume of malware is growing faster every year and poses a serious global security threat. Consequently, malware detection has become a critical topic in computer security. Currently, signature-based detection is the most widespread method used in commercial antivirus. In spite of the broad use of this method, it can detect malware only after the malicious executable has already caused damage and provided the malware is adequately documented. Therefore, the signature-based method consistently fails to detect new malware. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect unknown malware families. This model is based on the frequency of the appearance of opcode sequences. Furthermore, we describe a technique to mine the relevance of each opcode and assess the frequency of each opcode sequence. In addition, we provide empirical validation that this new method is capable of detecting unknown malware. }

As a consequence, there is a need for real-life case studies suggesting methodologies to conduct process mining analysis and to show the benefits of its application in real-life environments. In this paper we present a methodological framework for a multi-faceted analysis of real-life event logs based on Process Mining. As such, we demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of process mining techniques to expose organizational inefficiencies in a real-life case study that is centered on the back office process of a large Belgian insurance company. Our analysis shows that process mining techniques constitute an ideal means to tackle organizational challenges by suggesting process improvements and creating a company-wide process awareness. }

Furthermore, blogs represent an important new arena in agriculture sector for knowledge discovery since farmers use them for professional reasons. Opinion mining is a kind of text mining. Its goal is to assess the attitude of the author with respect to a given subject. The attitude may be a positive or negative opinion. This paper outlines the challenges and opportunities of the blogs for agriculture in terms of analyzing the information which is stored in them. The used technique in an experiment blog with the aid of the RapidMiner software is opinion mining. This framework may thus help establish baselines for these opinion mining tasks in agriculture. }

We investigated different scenarios of daily average influent \{CBOD\} and influent flow rate measured at 15&#xa0;min intervals. Then, we used five data-mining algorithms, i.e., multi-layered perceptron, k-nearest neighbor, multi-variate adaptive regression spline, support vector machine, and random forest, to construct day-ahead, time-series prediction models for TSS. Historical \{TSS\} values were used as input parameters to predict current and future values of TSS. A sliding-window approach was used to improve the results of the predictions. }

This main purpose of this study is to understand the self-care behavior of elderly participants in a developed self-care service system that provides self-care service and to analyze the daily self-care activities and health status of elders who live at home alone. To understand elder self-care patterns, log data from actual cases of elder self-care service were collected and analysed by Web usage mining. This study analysed 3391 sessions of 157 elders for the month of March, 2012. First, self-care use cycle, time, function numbers, and the depth and extent (range) of services were statistically analysed. Association rules were then used for data mining to find relationship between these functions of self-care behavior. Second, data from interest-based representation schemes were used to construct elder sessions. The ART2-enhance K-mean algorithm was then used to mine cluster patterns. Finally, sequential profiles for elder self-care behavior patterns were captured by applying sequence-based representation schemes in association with Markov models and ART2-enhanced K-mean clustering algorithms for sequence behavior mining cluster patterns for the elders. The analysis results can be used for research in medicine, public health, nursing and psychology and for policy-making in the health care domain. }

Due to the physical separation among data sources and computational resources, it is often necessary to deploy such stream mining systems in a distributed fashion, where local learners have access to disjoint subsets of the data that is to be mined, and forward their intermediate results to an ensemble learner that combines the results from the local learners. In this paper, we develop a design methodology for integrated de- sign, simulation, and implementation of dynamic data-driven adaptive stream mining systems. By systematically integrating considerations associated with local embedded processing, classifier configuration, data-driven adaptation and networked com- munication, our approach allows for effective assessment, prototyping, and implementation of alternative distributed design methods for data-driven, adaptive stream mining systems. We demonstrate our results on a dynamic data-driven application involving patient health care monitoring. }

For acquiring the established network model’s width and depth, a clustering algorithm based on density was adopted and a recursion algorithm was designed to solve such problems. An objective, comprehensive and scale-free evaluation function was further presented to rank the potential seed users by using the width and the depth obtained above.

In this work, we tackle this task in a domain-oriented approach, defining a set of domain-specific resources which capture valuable knowledge about how people express opinions on a given domain. These resources are automatically induced from a set of annotated documents. Some experiments were carried out on three different domains (user-generated reviews of headphones, hotels and cars), comparing our approach to other state-of-the-art, domain-independent techniques. The results confirm the importance of the domain in order to build accurate opinion extraction systems. Some experiments on the influence of the dataset size and an example of aggregation and visualization of the extracted opinions are also shown. }

In the second stage, a mixed logit model is estimated, using the antecedent part of the mined-rules as explanatory variables, to test the significance of the risk conditions. A total of 5563 one-vehicle crash cases (226 fatalities, 1593 injuries and 3744 property losses) occurred in Taiwan's freeways over 2003–2007 are analyzed. The \{GMR\} model has mined 29 rules for use. By incorporating these 29 mined-rules into a mixed logit model, we further identify one key safe condition and four key risk conditions leading to serious crashes (i.e., fatalities and injuries). Each key risk condition is discussed and compared with its adjacent rules. Based on the findings, some countermeasures to rectify the freeway's serious one-vehicle crashes are proposed. }

  abstract = {Much academic research has been conducted about the process of association rule mining. More effort is now required for practical application of association rules in various commercial fields. A potential application of association rule mining is the problem of product assignment in retail. The product assignment problem involves how to most effectively assign items to sites in retail stores to grow sales. Effective product assignment facilitates cross-selling and convenient shopping for customers to promote maximum sales for retailers. However, little practical research has been done to address the issue. The current study approaches the product assignment problem using association rule mining for retail environments. There are some barriers to overcome in applying association rule mining to the product assignment problem for retail. This study conducts some generalizing to overcome drawbacks caused by the short lifecycles of current products. As a measure of cross-selling, lift is used to compare the effectiveness of various assignments for products. The proposed algorithm consists of three processes, which include mining associations among items, nearest neighbor assignments, and updating assignments. The algorithm was tested on synthetic databases. The results show very effective product assignment in terms of the potential for cross-selling to drive maximum sales for retailers. }

An experiment is also conducted, using hotel and restaurant reviews obtained from TripAdvisor, to evaluate our proposals. Results showed that tourism product reviews available on web sites contain valuable information about customer preferences that can be extracted using an aspect-based opinion mining approach. The proposed approach proved to be very effective in determining the sentiment orientation of opinions, achieving a precision and recall of 90%.

The agents in each one of the layers are specialized in specific tasks, such as data gathering, data classification, and visualization. This study presents two key agents under a hybrid architecture: a classifier agent that incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning engine employing advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages, and a visualizer agent that integrates several techniques to facilitate the visual analysis of suspicious queries. The former incorporates a new classification model based on a mixture of a neural network and a Support Vector Machine in order to classify \{SQL\} queries in a reliable way. The latter combines clustering and neural projection techniques to support the visual analysis and identification of target attacks. The proposed approach was tested in a real-traffic case study and its experimental results, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this paper. }

The current methods of text mining and data mining used for this purpose focus only on the frequency of which subjects are mentioned, and ignore the novelty of the subject which is also critical, but beyond the scope of a frequency study. This work tackles this inadequacy to propose a new set of indices for emerging topic detection. They are the novelty index (NI) and the published volume index (PVI). This new set of indices is created based on time, volume, frequency and represents a resolution to provide a more precise set of prediction indices. They are then utilized to determine the detection point (DP) of new emerging topics. Following the detection point, the intersection decides the worth of a new topic. The algorithms presented in this paper can be used to decide the novelty and life span of an emerging topic in a specific field. The entire comprehensive collection of the \{ACM\} Digital Library is examined in the experiments. The application of the \{NI\} and \{PVI\} gives a promising indication of emerging topics in conferences and journals. }

The contents of microblogs preserve valuable information associated with past disastrous events and stories. To learn the experiences from past events for tackling emerging real-world events, in this work we utilize the social-media messages to characterize real-world events through mining their contents and extracting essential features for relatedness analysis. On one hand, we established an online clustering approach on Twitter microblogs for detecting emerging events, and meanwhile we performed event relatedness evaluation using an unsupervised clustering approach. On the other hand, we developed a supervised learning model to create extensible measure metrics for offline evaluation of event relatedness. By means of supervised learning, our developed measure metrics are able to compute relatedness of various historical events, allowing the event impacts on specified domains to be quantitatively measured for event comparison. By combining the strengths of both methods, the experimental results showed that the combined framework in our system is sensible for discovering more unknown knowledge about event impacts and enhancing event awareness. }

Despite many efforts on data cleaning for web server logs, it is still an open question for enterprise proxy logs. With unlimited accesses to websites, enterprise proxy logs trace web requests from multiple clients to multiple web servers,which make them quite different from web sever logs on both location and content. Therefore, many irrelevant items such as software updating requests cannot be filtered out by traditional data cleaning methods. In this paper, we propose the first method named \{EPLogCleaner\} that can filter out plenty of irrelevant items based on the common prefix of their URLs. We make an evaluation of \{EPLogCleaner\} with a real network traffic trace captured from one enterprise proxy. Experimental results show that \{EPLogCleaner\} can improve data quality of enterprise proxy logs by further filtering out more than 30% \{URL\} requests comparing with traditional data cleaning methods. }

Most of the scientists in this field put emphasis on issues related to applications of Wireless Sensor Networks in different areas, while we here put emphasis on categorization of the selected approaches from the open literature, to help application designers/developers get a better understanding of their options in different areas. Our main goal is to provide a good starting point for a more effective analysis leading to possible new solutions, possible improvements of existing solutions, and possible combination of two or more of the existing solutions into new ones, using the hybridization principle. Another contribution of this article is a synergistic interdisciplinary review of problems in two areas: Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.

However, most existing document classification algorithms are easily affected by ambiguous terms. The ability to disambiguate for a classifier is thus as important as the ability to classify accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel classification framework based on fuzzy formal concept analysis to conceptualize documents into a more abstract form of concepts, and use these as the training examples to alleviate the arbitrary outcomes caused by ambiguous terms. The proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark testbed and two opinion polarity datasets. The experimental results indicate superior performance in all datasets. Applying concept analysis to opinion polarity classification is a leading endeavor in the disambiguation of Web 2.0 contents, and the approach presented in this paper offers significant improvements on current methods. The results of the proposed model reveal its ability to decrease the sensitivity to noise, as well as its adaptability in cross domain applications. }

  abstract = {Recommender systems have been developed in variety of domains, including asynchronous discussion group which is one of the most interesting ones. Due to the information overload and its varieties in discussion groups, it is difficult to draw out the relevant information. Therefore, recommender systems play an important role in filtering and customizing the desired information. Nowadays, collaborative and content-based filtering are the most adopted techniques being utilized in recommender systems. The collaborative filtering technique recommends items based on liked-mind users’ opinions and users’ preferences. Alternatively, the aim of the content-based filtering technique is the identification of items which are similar to those a user has preferred in past. To overcome the drawbacks of the aforementioned techniques, a hybrid recommender system combines two or more recommendation techniques to obtain more accuracy. The most important achievement of this study is to present a novel approach in hybrid recommendation systems, which identifies the user similarity neighborhood from implicit information being collected in a discussion group. In the proposed system, initially the association rules mining technique is applied to discover the similar users, and then the related posts are recommended to them. To select the appropriate contents in the transacted posts, it is necessary to focus on the concepts rather than the key words. Therefore, to locate the semantic related concepts Word Sense Disambiguation strategy based on WordNet lexical database is exploited. The experiments carried out on the discussion group datasets proved a noticeable improvement on the accuracy of useful posts recommended to the users in comparison to content-based and the collaborative filtering techniques as well. }

Then a new algorithm based on electric field is proposed to visualize the layout of the relationship links. A prediction method based on three diffusion models is presented to predict the number of retweets over time. Finally, three real world case studies show the validity of our methods. }

  abstract = {Wind power generated by wind turbines has a non-schedulable nature due to the stochastic nature of meteorological conditions. Hence, wind power predictions are required for few seconds to one week ahead in turbine control, load tracking, pre-load sharing, power system management and energy trading. In order to overcome problems in the predictions, many different wind power prediction models have been used to achieve in the literature. Data mining and its applications have more attention in recent years. This paper presents a review study banned on very short-term, short-term, medium-term and long-term wind power predictions. The studies available in the literature have been evaluated and criticized in consideration with their prediction accuracies and deficiencies. It is shown that adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, neural networks and multilayer perceptrons give better results in wind power predictions. }

Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because \{AGMI\} presented many association rules that provided a 90% correct identification of cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection, prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement processes. }

A novel approach that compares textual and non-textual data for anomaly detection is proposed. It combines association and ontology based text mining. Association mining has been employed to identify the repairs performed in the field for a given symptom, whereas, text mining is used to infer repairs from the textual instructions mentioned in service documents for the same symptom. These in turn are compared and contrasted to identify the anomalous cases. The developed approach has been applied to automotive field data. Using the top 20 most frequent symptoms, observed in a mid-sized sedan built and sold in North America, it is demonstrated that \{DATAM\} can identify all the anomalous symptom – repair code combinations (with a false positive rate of 0.04). This knowledge, in the form of anomalies, can subsequently be used to improve the service/trouble-shooting procedure and identify technician training needs. }

  abstract = {Objective Clinical pathway analysis, as a pivotal issue in ensuring specialized, standardized, normalized and sophisticated therapy procedures, is receiving increasing attention in the field of medical informatics. Clinical pathway pattern mining is one of the most important components of clinical pathway analysis and aims to discover which medical behaviors are essential/critical for clinical pathways, and also where temporal orders of these medical behaviors are quantified with numerical bounds. Even though existing clinical pathway pattern mining techniques can tell us which medical behaviors are frequently performed and in which order, they seldom precisely provide quantified temporal order information of critical medical behaviors in clinical pathways. Methods This study adopts process mining to analyze clinical pathways. The key contribution of the paper is to develop a new process mining approach to find a set of clinical pathway patterns given a specific clinical workflow log and minimum support threshold. The proposed approach not only discovers which critical medical behaviors are performed and in which order, but also provides comprehensive knowledge about quantified temporal orders of medical behaviors in clinical pathways. Results The proposed approach is evaluated via real-world data-sets, which are extracted from Zhejiang Huzhou Central hospital of China with regard to six specific diseases, i.e., bronchial lung cancer, gastric cancer, cerebral hemorrhage, breast cancer, infarction, and colon cancer, in two years (2007.08–2009.09). As compared to the general sequence pattern mining algorithm, the proposed approach consumes less processing time, generates quite a smaller number of clinical pathway patterns, and has a linear scalability in terms of execution time against the increasing size of data sets. Conclusion The experimental results indicate the applicability of the proposed approach, based on which it is possible to discover clinical pathway patterns that can cover most frequent medical behaviors that are most regularly encountered in clinical practice. Therefore, it holds significant promise in research efforts related to the analysis of clinical pathways. }

It constitutes a significant advance with relation to a previous study made in 2008, both in terms of methodology and extended knowledge on the patterns’ details. This work uses more recent data (2005–2007) and this time the identification of the “typical accident” shifts from a bivariate, to a multivariate pattern, for characterising more accurately the accident mechanisms. Instead of crossing only two variables (Deviation x Contact), the new methodology developed here uses data mining techniques to associate nine variables, through their categories, and to quantify the statistical cohesion of each pattern. The results confirmed the “typical accident” of the 2008 study, but went much further: it reveals three statistically significant patterns (the top-3 categories in frequency); moreover, each pattern includes now more variables (4–5 categories) and indicates their statistical cohesion. This approach allowed a more accurate vision of the reality, which is fundamental for risk management. The methodology is best suited for large groups, such as national Authorities, Insurers or Corporate Groups, to assist them planning target-oriented safety strategies. Not least importantly, researchers can apply the same algorithm to other study areas, as it is not restricted to accidents, neither to safety. }

In recent years, two major approaches have been proposed to determine opinions at the feature level: model based methods such as the one based on lexicalized Hidden Markov Model (L-HMMs), and statistical methods like the association rule mining based technique. However, little work has compared these algorithms regarding their practical abilities in identifying various types of review elements, such as features, opinions, intensifiers, entity phrases and infrequent entities. On the other hand, little attentions has been paid to applying more discriminative learning models to accomplish these opinion mining tasks. In this paper, we not only experimentally compared these methods based on a real-world review dataset, but also in particular adopted the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model and evaluated its performance in comparison with related algorithms. Moreover, for CRFs-based mining algorithm, we tested the role of a self-tagging process in two automatic training conditions, and further identified the ideal combination of learning functions to optimize its learning performance. The comparative experiment eventually revealed the CRFs-based method’s outperforming accuracy in terms of mining multiple review elements, relative to other methods. }

This paper presents a data mining approach to address the resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow resource management. Specifically, an Apriori-like algorithm is used to find the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a correlation measure named lift is utilized to annotate the negatively correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the rules are ranked using the confidence measures as resource allocation rules. Comparative experiments are performed using C4.5, SVM, ID3, Naïve Bayes and the presented approach, and the results show that the presented approach is effective in both accuracy and candidate resource recommendations. }

Since the knowledge-based economy has evolved, the method for creating firm value has transferred from traditional physical assets to intangible knowledge. Therefore, valuation of intangible assets has become a widespread topic of interest in the future of the economy. This study takes advantage of feature selection, an important data-preprocessing step in data mining, to identify important and representative factors affecting intangible assets. Particularly, five feature selection methods are considered, which include principal component analysis (PCA), stepwise regression (STEPWISE), decision trees (DT), association rules (AR), and genetic algorithms (GA). In addition, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are used as the prediction model in order to understand which features selected from these five methods can allow the prediction model to perform best. Based on the chosen dataset containing 61 variables, the experimental result shows that combining the results from multiple feature selection methods performs the best. GA&#xa0;∩&#xa0;STEPWISE, DT&#xa0;∪&#xa0;PCA, and the \{DT\} single feature selection method generate approximately 75% prediction accuracy, which select 26, 22, and 7 variables respectively. }

In this work, we utilized text- and photo-types of location information with a novel approach of information fusion that exploits effective image annotation and location based text-mining approaches to enhance identification of geographic location and spatial cognition. In this paper, we describe our feature extraction methods to annotating images, and utilizing text mining approach to analyze images and texts simultaneously, in order to carry out geospatial text mining and image classification tasks. Subsequently, photo-images and textual documents are projected to a unified feature space, in order to generate a co-constructed semantic space for information fusion.

  abstract = {Abstract Network ecology holds great promise as an approach to modelling and predicting the effects of agricultural management on ecosystem service provision, as it bridges the gap between community and ecosystem ecology. Unfortunately, trophic interactions between most species in agricultural farmland are not well characterised empirically, and only partial food webs are available for a few systems. Large agricultural datasets of the nodes (i.e., species) in the webs are now available, and if these can be enriched with information on the links between them then the current shortage of network data can potentially be overcome. We demonstrate that a logic-based machine learning method can be used to automatically assign interactions between nodes, thereby generating plausible and testable food webs from ecological census data. Many of the learned trophic links were corroborated by the literature: in particular, links ascribed with high probability by machine learning corresponded with those having multiple references in the literature. In some cases, previously unobserved but high probability links were suggested and subsequently confirmed by other research groups. We evaluate these food webs using a new cross-validation method and present new results on automatic corroboration of a large, complex food web. The simulated frequencies of trophic links were also correlated with the total number of literature ‘hits’ for these links from the automatic corroboration. Finally, we also show that a network constructed by learning trophic links between functional groups is at least as accurate as the species-based trophic network. }

In this paper, we address the problem of recovering such constraints automatically, a problem referred to as specification mining. Given some client programs that use a given library, we identify constraints on the library usage that are (almost) satisfied by the given set of clients. The class of rules we target for mining combines simple binary temporal operators with state predicates (composed of equality constraints) and quantification. This is a simple yet expressive subclass of temporal properties (LTL formulae) that allows us to capture many common \{API\} usage rules. We focus on recovering rules from execution traces and apply classical data mining concepts to be robust against bugs (API usage rule violations) in clients. We present new algorithms for mining rules from execution traces. We show how a propositional rule mining algorithm can be generalized to treat quantification and state predicates in a unified way. Our approach enables the miner to be complete (i.e. , mine all rules within the targeted class that are satisfied by the given traces) while avoiding an exponential blowup. We have implemented these algorithms and used them to mine \{API\} usage rules for several Windows APIs. Our experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. }

The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach. }

Although prior research has shown that diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment, this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models. Comparison of the results shows that having more information about comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power, which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. }

As yet, there has been limited analytical attention paid to the political struggles and power dynamics that get reflected through specific \{CSR\} guidelines and their implementation in local contexts; this is particularly apparent with respect to the human rights dimension of CSR, and more specifically, indigenous rights. This study documents the debates, issues of accountability, and different interpretations of \{CSR\} between \{NGOs\} representing indigenous rights and a mining corporation. These debates focus on environmental impact assessments; indigenous rights to land; and the indigenous right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent. These exchanges illustrate the socio-political, as well as economic, positioning of these actors, and the different agendas associated with their positions that determine issues of accountability and shape alternate interpretations of \{CSR\} guidelines. The outcomes of these debates also reflect the different degrees of power that these actors hold in such contexts, irrespective of the strength or validity of their arguments about CSR. This dialogue is thereby a lens into the more complex and contentious entanglements that emerge with \{CSR\} as a mode of governance, as it plays out ‘on the ground.’ These findings also reinforce questions regarding what we can expect of \{CSR\} as a mode of governance for addressing human rights issues with resource extraction projects, particularly within the constraints of overriding political and social structures. }

Novel sentence mining can discover novel, yet relevant, sentences given a specific topic defined by a user. In real-time novelty mining, an important issue is to how to select a suitable novelty metric that quantitatively measures the novelty of a particular sentence. To utilize the merits of different metrics, a blended metric is proposed by combining both cosine similarity and new word count metrics. The blended metric has been tested on \{TREC\} 2003 and \{TREC\} 2004 Novelty Track data. The experimental results show that the blended metric can perform generally better on topics with different ratios of novelty, which is useful for real-time novelty mining in topics with varying degrees of novelty. }

However, a lacuna still remains in the literature as to systematic design of convergent product concepts (CPCs) based on functionality. This study proposes a systematic approach to design of \{CPCs\} based on online community information using data mining techniques. At the heart of the suggested approach is the combined use of association rule mining (ARM) and decision tree (DT) for discovering the significant relationships among items and detecting the meaningful conditions of items. Specifically, the proposed approach is composed of four steps: data collection and transformation, definition of target functions, identification of critical product features, and specification of design details. Three maps – function co-preferences map, feature relations map, and concepts specification map – are developed to aid decision making in design of CPCs, structuring and visualizing design implications. A case of the portable multimedia player (PMP) is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. We believe that our approach can reduce uncertainty and risk involved in the concept design stage. }

Many \{DR\} systems have been developed to capture \{DR\} since the 1970s. However, the \{DR\} capture process is heavily human involved. In addition, with the increasing amount of \{DR\} available in archived design documents, it has become an acute problem to research a new computational approach that is able to capture \{DR\} from free textual contents effectively. In our previous study, we have proposed an \{ISAL\} (issue, solution and artifact layer) model for \{DR\} representation. In this paper, we focus on algorithm design to discover \{DR\} from design documents according to the \{ISAL\} modeling. For the issue layer of the \{ISAL\} model, we define a semantic sentence graph to model sentence relationships through language patterns. Based on this graph, we improve the manifold-ranking algorithm to extract issue-bearing sentences. To discover solution–reason bearing sentences for the solution layer, we propose building up two sentence graphs based on candidate solution-bearing sentences and reason-bearing sentences respectively, and propagating information between them. For artifact information extraction, we propose two term relations, i.e. positional term relation and mutual term relation. Using these relations, we extend our document profile model to score the candidate terms. The performance and scalability of the algorithms proposed are tested using patents as research data joined with an example of prior art search to illustrate its application prospects. }

However, such verbal information is seldom used in the screening and diagnosis process probably because the procedure to handle these words is rather difficult with traditional quantitative methods. The first challenge would be to extract robust information from diversified expression patterns, the second to transform unstructured text into a structuralized dataset. The present study developed a new textual assessment method to screen the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients using lexical features in the self narratives with text mining techniques. Using 300 self narratives collected online, we extracted highly discriminative keywords with the Chi-square algorithm and constructed a textual assessment model to classify individuals with the presence or absence of PTSD. This resulted in a high agreement between computer and psychiatrists' diagnoses for \{PTSD\} and revealed some expressive characteristics in the writings of \{PTSD\} patients. Although the results of text analysis are not completely analogous to the results of structured interviews in \{PTSD\} diagnosis, the application of text mining is a promising addition to assessing \{PTSD\} in clinical and research settings. }

Instead, they often require custom scaling tricks and designs that are costly to maintain and that are not reusable for other types of analysis. We believe that the web community has faced many of these software engineering scaling challenges before, as web analyses have to cope with the enormous growth of web data. In this paper, we report on our experience in using a web-scale platform (i.e., Pig) as a data preparation language to aid large-scale \{MSR\} studies. Through three case studies, we carefully validate the use of this web platform to prepare (i.e., Extract, Transform, and Load, ETL) data for further analysis. Despite several limitations, we still encourage \{MSR\} researchers to leverage Pig in their large-scale studies because of Pig's scalability and flexibility. Our experience report will help other researchers who want to scale their analyses. }

We analyzed the data of 42 participants working together in dyads. They had 90&#xa0;min to develop a common handout on a statistical topic while communicating only via chat and common editor. The log files of chat and editor were coded regarding activities of social regulation. Results show that participants in dyads with higher group performance (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) did not differ from participants with lower group performance (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;22) in the frequencies of regulatory activities. In an exploratory way, we used process mining to identify process patterns for high versus low group performance dyads. The resulting models show clear parallels between high and low achieving dyads in a double loop of working on the task, monitoring, and coordinating. Moreover, there are no major differences in the process of high versus low achieving dyads. Both results are discussed with regard to theoretical and empirical issues. Furthermore, the method of process mining is discussed. }

  abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most damaging attacks on the Internet security today. Recently, malicious web crawlers have been used to execute automated \{DDoS\} attacks on web sites across the WWW. In this study we examine the effect of applying seven well-established data mining classification algorithms on static web server access logs in order to: (1) classify user sessions as belonging to either automated web crawlers or human visitors and (2) identify which of the automated web crawlers sessions exhibit ‘malicious’ behavior and are potentially participants in a \{DDoS\} attack. The classification performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, recall, precision and \{F1\} score. Seven out of nine vector (i.e. web-session) features employed in our work are borrowed from earlier studies on classification of user sessions as belonging to web crawlers. However, we also introduce two novel web-session features: the consecutive sequential request ratio and standard deviation of page request depth. The effectiveness of the new features is evaluated in terms of the information gain and gain ratio metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the new features to improve the accuracy of data mining classifiers in identifying malicious and well-behaved web crawler sessions. }

Based on prior research and own projects, three building blocks of online opinion tracking and simulation are described: (1) automated topic, emotion and opinion detection in real-time, (2) information flow modeling and agent-based simulation, and (3) modeling of opinion networks, including special social and psychological circumstances, such as the influence of emotions, media and leaders, changing social networks etc. Finally, three application scenarios are presented to illustrate the framework and motivate further research. }

First, the user must specify a minimum support for mining. Typically it may require tuning the value of the minimum support many times before a set of useful association rules could be obtained. However, it is not easy for the user to find an appropriate minimum support. Secondly, there are usually a lot of frequent itemsets generated in the mining result. It will result in the generation of a large number of association rules, giving rise to difficulties of applications. In this paper, we consider mining top-k frequent closed itemsets from data streams using a sliding window technique. A single pass algorithm, called FCI_max, is developed for the generation of top-k frequent closed itemsets of length no more than max_l. Our method can efficiently resolve the mentioned two difficulties in association rule mining, which promotes the usability of the mining result in practice. }

The results showed that \{C5\} decision tree algorithm is the best predictor with 95% accuracy on hold-out sample, followed by support vector machines (with an accuracy of 91%) and artificial neural networks (with an accuracy of 89%). Logistic regression models came out to be the least accurate of the four with and overall accuracy of 82%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that previous test experience, whether a student has a scholarship, student’s number of siblings, previous years’ grade point average are among the most important predictors of the placement test scores. }

Due to its tree-structure paradigm, \{XML\} is superior for its capability of storing and querying complex data for ebXML applications.

In this paper, we present an efficient mining algorithm, namely ebXMiner, to discover the frequent \{XML\} query patterns for ebXML applications. Unlike the existing algorithms, we propose a new idea by collecting the equivalent \{XML\} queries and then enumerating the candidates from infrequent \{XML\} queries in our ebXMiner.

A number of constitutive models have been developed to describe the complex behaviour of unsaturated soils.

In this paper an alternative new approach is presented, based on the Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) technique. \{EPR\} is a data mining technique that generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from input test data. The capabilities of the proposed EPR-based framework in modelling of behaviour of unsaturated soils are illustrated using results from a comprehensive set of triaxial tests on samples of compacted unsaturated soils from literature. The main parameters used for modelling of the behaviour of unsaturated soils during shearing are initial water content, initial dry density, mean net stress, axial strain, suction, volumetric strain, and deviator stress. The model developed is used to predict different aspects of the behaviour of unsaturated soils for conditions not used in the model building process. The results show that the proposed approach provides a useful framework for modelling of unsaturated soils. The merits and advantages of the proposed approach are highlighted. }

In this work we introduce a methodology for the application of process mining techniques that leads to the identification of regular behavior, process variants, and exceptional medical cases. The approach is demonstrated in a case study conducted at a hospital emergency service. For this purpose, we implemented the methodology in a tool that integrates the main stages of process analysis.

In this context, this paper designs and examines an automatic approach to forecast the daily outbreak of political risk from social media at a topic level. It evaluates the forecasting performances of topic features, investigated among the previous works that analyze social media data for politics, hidden Markov model (HMM)-based techniques, widely used for the anomaly detection with time-series data, and detection models, into which the topic features and the detection techniques are combined. When applied to South Korea's Web forum, Daum Agora, statistical comparisons with the constraints of false positive rate of &lt;&#xa0;0.1 and timeliness of &lt;&#xa0;0 show that, for accuracy, social network-based feature and, for sensitivity, energy-based feature give the best results but there is no single best detection technique for accuracy and sensitivity. Besides, they demonstrate that the detection model using Markov switching model with jumps (MSJ) with social-network based feature is the best combination for accuracy; there is no single best detection model for sensitivity. This paper helps make a move to prevent the national political risk, and eventually the predictive governance benefits the people. }

However, non-unique mapping of classification codes onto specific products/markets and the difficulties in accurately capturing knowledge flows based just on citation linkages present limitations to these conventional patent analysis approaches. We present a natural language processing based hierarchical technique that enables the automatic identification and classification of patent datasets into technology areas and sub-areas. The key novelty of our technique is to use topic modeling to map patents to probability distributions over real world categories/topics. Accuracy and usefulness of our technique are tested on a dataset of 10,201 patents in solar photovoltaics filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 2002 and 2013. We show that linguistic features from topic models can be used to effectively identify the main technology area that a patent's invention applies to. Our computational experiments support the view that the topic distribution of a patent offers a reduced-form representation of the knowledge content in a patent. Accordingly, we suggest that this hidden thematic structure in patents can be useful in studies of the policy–innovation–geography nexus. To that end, we also demonstrate an application of our technique for identifying patterns in technological convergence. }

In this paper, we present a new data representation called NC_set, which keeps track of the complete information used for mining erasable itemsets. Based on NC_set, we propose a new algorithm called \{MERIT\} for mining erasable itemsets efficiently. The efficiency of \{MERIT\} is achieved with three techniques as follows. First, the NC_set is a compact structure, which prunes irrelevant data automatically. Second, the computation of the gain of an itemset is transformed into the combination of NC_sets, which can be completed in linear time complexity by an ingenious strategy. Third, \{MERIT\} can directly find erasable itemsets without generating candidate itemsets in some cases. For evaluating MERIT, we have conducted extensive experiments on a lot of synthetic product databases. Our performance study shows that the \{MERIT\} is efficient and is on average about two orders of magnitude faster than the META, the first algorithm for mining erasable itemsets. }

Even though facts still play a very important role when information is sought on a topic, opinions have become increasingly important as well. Opinions expressed in blogs and social networks are playing an important role influencing everything from the products people buy to the presidential candidate they support. Thus, there is a need for a new type of search engine which will not only retrieve facts, but will also enable the retrieval of opinions. Such a search engine can be used in a number of diverse applications like product reviews to aggregating opinions on a political candidate or issue. Enterprises can also use such an engine to determine how users perceive their products and how they stand with respect to competition. This paper presents an algorithm which not only analyzes the overall sentiment of a document/review, but also identifies the semantic orientation of specific components of the review that lead to a particular sentiment. The algorithm is integrated in an opinion search engine which presents results to a query along with their overall tone and a summary of sentiments of the most important features. }

Fuzzy time-interval sequential pattern mining is one type of serviceable data-mining technique that discovers customer behavioral patterns over time. To take a shopping example, (Bread, Short, Milk, Long, Jam), means that Bread is bought before Milk in a Short period, and Jam is bought after Milk in a Long period, where Short and Long are predetermined linguistic terms given by managers. This information shown in this example reveals more general and concise knowledge for managers, allowing them to make quick-response decisions, especially in business. However, no studies, to our knowledge, have yet to address the issue of changes in fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns. The fuzzy time-interval sequential pattern, (Bread, Short, Milk, Long, Jam), became available in last year; however, is not a trend this year, and has been substituted by (Bread, Short, Yogurt, Short, Jam). Without updating this knowledge, managers might map out inappropriate marketing plans for products or services and dated inventory strategies with respect to time-intervals. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel change mining model, MineFuzzChange, to detect the change in fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns. Using a brick-and-mortar transactional dataset collected from a retail chain in Taiwan and a \{B2C\} \{EC\} dataset, experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed model. We empirically demonstrate how the model helps managers to understand the changing behaviors of their customers and to formulate timely marketing and inventory strategies. }

Until now, this source of potentially very valuable information remains largely untapped. In this study, we address this issue by investigating the applicability of different data mining techniques to identify the main drivers of student satisfaction in two business education institutions. In the end, the resulting models are to be used by the management to support the strategic decision making process. Hence, the aspect of model comprehensibility is considered to be at least equally important as model performance. It is found that data mining techniques are able to select a surprisingly small number of constructs that require attention in order to manage student satisfaction. }

  abstract = {Abstract The information that connects genotypes and phenotypes is essentially embedded in research articles written in natural language. To facilitate access to this knowledge, we constructed a framework for the curation of the scientific literature studying the molecular mechanisms that control leaf growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Standard structured statements, called relations, were designed to capture diverse data types, including phenotypes and gene expression linked to genotype description, growth conditions, genetic and molecular interactions, and details about molecular entities. Relations were then annotated from the literature, defining the relevant terms according to standard biomedical ontologies. This curation process was supported by a dedicated graphical user interface, called Leaf Knowtator. A total of 283 primary research articles were curated by a community of annotators, yielding 9947 relations monitored for consistency and over 12,500 references to Arabidopsis genes. This information was converted into a relational database (KnownLeaf) and merged with other public Arabidopsis resources relative to transcriptional networks, protein–protein interaction, gene co-expression, and additional molecular annotations. Within KnownLeaf, leaf phenotype data can be searched together with molecular data originating either from this curation initiative or from external public resources. Finally, we built a network (LeafNet) with a portion of the KnownLeaf database content to graphically represent the leaf phenotype relations in a molecular context, offering an intuitive starting point for knowledge mining. Literature curation efforts such as ours provide high quality structured information accessible to computational analysis, and thereby to a wide range of applications. DATA: The presented work was performed in the framework of the AGRON-OMICS project (Arabidopsis \{GRO\} wth Network integrating \{OMICS\} technologies) supported by European Commission 6th Framework Programme project (Grant number LSHG-CT-2006-037704).

Typically a large number of frequent patterns, and by extension a large number of trends, are discovered. Thus, to assist with the analysis of the discovered trends, the use of \{SOM\} techniques is advocated so that similar trends can be grouped together. To identify “interesting” trends a sequences of \{SOMs\} are generated which can be interpreted by considering how trends move from one \{SOM\} to the next. The further a trend moves from one \{SOM\} to the next, the more “interesting” the trend is deemed to be. The study is focused two types of network, Star networks and Complex star networks, exemplified by two real applications: the Cattle Tracing System in operation in Great Britain and a car insurance quotation application. }

So far, numerous applications and services have been proposed, such as retrieval service. The retrieval, however, faces a big challenge in IoT because the data belongs to different domains and user interaction with the surrounding environment is constrained. This paper proposes Acrost, a retrieval system based on topic discovery and semantic awareness in IoT environment. The initial contents with interesting information is obtained through the combination of two topic centric collectors. The metadata is extracted by aggregating regular expression-based and conditional random fields-based approaches. Moreover, the semantic-aware retrieval is achieved by parsing the query and ranking the relevance of contents. In addition, we present a case study on academic conference retrieval to validate the proposed approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed system can significantly improve the response time and efficiency of topic self-adaptive retrieval manner. }

To facilitate real time mining of a large range of burst topics, in this paper, we proposed a method to discover burst topics in real time and trace their trends based on the variation trends of word frequencies. First, for the variation trend of the words in microblogs, we adopt a non-homogeneous Poisson process model to fit the data. To represent the heat and trend of the words, we introduce heat degree factor and trend degree factor and realise the real time discovery and trend tracing of the burst topics based on these two factors. Second, to improve the computing performance, this paper was based on the Storm stream computing framework for real time computing. Finally, the experimental results indicate that by adjusting the observation window size and trend degree threshold, topics with different cycles and different burst strengths can be discovered. }

First, this study develops a theoretical model based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3, and then examines its perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and its ability to explain users’ intentions to use DMTs. The model's determinants include 4 categories: the task-oriented dimension (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, response time, and format), control beliefs (computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control), emotion (computer anxiety), and intrinsic motivation (computer playfulness). This study also surveys the moderating effect of experience and output quality on the determinants of \{DMT\} adoption and use. An empirical study involving 206 \{DMT\} users was conducted to evaluate the model using structural equation modeling. Results demonstrate that the proposed model explains 58% of the variance. The findings of this study have interesting implications with respect to \{DMT\} adoption, both for researchers and practitioners. }

  abstract = {A challenge for sentence categorization and novelty mining is to detect not only when text is relevant to the user’s information need, but also when it contains something new which the user has not seen before. It involves two tasks that need to be solved. The first is identifying relevant sentences (categorization) and the second is identifying new information from those relevant sentences (novelty mining). Many previous studies of relevant sentence retrieval and novelty mining have been conducted on the English language, but few papers have addressed the problem of multilingual sentence categorization and novelty mining. This is an important issue in global business environments, where mining knowledge from text in a single language is not sufficient. In this paper, we perform the first task by categorizing Malay and Chinese sentences, then comparing their performances with that of English. Thereafter, we conduct novelty mining to identify the sentences with new information. Experimental results on \{TREC\} 2004 Novelty Track data show similar categorization performance on Malay and English sentences, which greatly outperform Chinese. In the second task, it is observed that we can achieve similar novelty mining results for all three languages, which indicates that our algorithm is suitable for novelty mining of multilingual sentences. In addition, after benchmarking our results with novelty mining without categorization, it is learnt that categorization is necessary for the successful performance of novelty mining. }

  abstract = {Sequential rule mining is an important data mining task used in a wide range of applications. However, current algorithms for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences use very restrictive definitions of sequential rules, which make them unable to recognize that similar rules can describe a same phenomenon. This can have many undesirable effects such as (1) similar rules that are rated differently, (2) rules that are not found because they are considered uninteresting when taken individually, (3) and rules that are too specific, which makes them less likely to be used for making predictions. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a more general form of sequential rules such that items in the antecedent and in the consequent of each rule are unordered. We propose an algorithm named \{CMRules\} for mining this form of rules. The algorithm proceeds by first finding association rules to prune the search space for items that occur jointly in many sequences. Then it eliminates association rules that do not meet the minimum confidence and support thresholds according to the sequential ordering. We evaluate the performance of \{CMRules\} in three different ways. First, we provide an analysis of its time complexity. Second, we compare its performance (in terms of execution time, memory usage and scalability) with an adaptation of an algorithm from the literature that we name CMDeo. For this comparison, we use three real-life public datasets, which have different characteristics and represent three kinds of data. In many cases, results show that \{CMRules\} is faster and has a better scalability for low support thresholds than CMDeo. Lastly, we report a successful application of the algorithm in a tutoring agent. }

Localized tyre deformations and rim displacements were measured using optical displacement transducers and post-processing high-speed camera images using digital image analysis software. A validation analysis illustrated a maximum difference of 4.05% of vertical wheel displacements between the aforementioned methods. Quasi-static tests show the maximum values of vertical rim displacement and lateral tyre deflection are in the range of 72.2–78.9&#xa0;mm and 23.3–27.1&#xa0;mm, respectively, for a severe excitation condition. Differences ranging from 0.2% to 21.5% for maximum vertical and lateral tyre deflections were found between static load tests and engineering data provided by the tyre manufacturer. Linear relationships were observed for both vertical wheel displacement and lateral tyre deflection versus load for all tests. This study demonstrates a thorough methodology to study deflection characteristics of heavy duty \{OTR\} tyres and the collected data could be very useful in the development of numerical models of wheel and tyre assemblies for mining vehicles. }

Also, these models contain three increasingly basic, intermediate and detailed forms, i.e. basic \{COCOMO\} is suitable for quick, early, rough order of among the estimates of required effort in producing software, but its accuracy is limited due to its loss of factors to account for difference between cost drivers. Intermediate \{COCOMO\} assumes these project attributes into account. In addition detailed \{COCOMO\} accounts for individual project phases used. The \{COCOMO\} algorithmic techniques families have used since 1981. In recent years, some techniques emerged by using intelligent techniques to solve and estimate the effort required in producing software. In this paper, different data mining techniques to estimate software costs are presented and then the results of each technique are evaluated and compared. However, NASA's projects to train and test each of these techniques are applied. Then, data set to train and test the data mining techniques improve the estimation accuracy of the models in many cases. We show the comparison between \{COCOMO\} model and data mining techniques here. The results indicate that these methods result in many benefit answers. Also we show the comparison of the estimation accuracy of \{COCOMO\} model with data mining techniques. Data mining techniques improve the estimation accuracy of the models in many cases. So the estimated effort more improvement in this models. }

With over 1000 databases online, it is clearly not feasible for researchers to manually search each one for information about the genes and processes in which they are interested. Much of the data stored in these databases never makes it into the peer-reviewed literature, and so becomes essentially unavailable in its entirety. A powerful approach to maximising the usefulness of large datasets, whether generated in-house or obtained from public repositories, is data integration and mining. Data integration is the process of bringing together large amounts of disparate data into a single, computationally accessible data source, while data mining is the process of finding hidden patterns and relationships in such large datasets. A wide range of algorithms is used for data mining, including established statistical methods, and approaches from the field of machine learning. The various algorithms available have different strengths and weaknesses, and are applicable to different types of data. In this review we first discuss the data mining life cycle and then describe some of the most widely used algorithms, illustrating their applications with examples from the microbiological literature. Where possible, we have identified freely available software for implementing these algorithms. }

Audits offer a tool through which to shape and regulate corporate social performance (CSP). Where audits have limited value is in their ability to stimulate internal engagement around social and organizational norms and principles, as the process relies on auditors to generate performance data against pre-selected indicators. Data is then utilized to produce a measure of risk or effectiveness through which to demonstrate compliance. Focusing on the internal organizational aspects of accountability and the processes, mechanisms and methodologies used to establish critical reflection, three alternatives within the current audit regime are presented. These forms of ‘new accounting’ stand in contrast to conventional auditing, as their focus is on building cross-functional connections and collaborative internal relationships that are based on dialogue and mutual exchange about the problems and possibilities of \{CSR\} implementation. }

Although cost reduction is their prime objective, churn prediction models are typically evaluated using statistically based performance measures, resulting in suboptimal model selection. Therefore, in the first part of this paper, a novel, profit centric performance measure is developed, by calculating the maximum profit that can be generated by including the optimal fraction of customers with the highest predicted probabilities to attrite in a retention campaign. The novel measure selects the optimal model and fraction of customers to include, yielding a significant increase in profits compared to statistical measures. In the second part an extensive benchmarking experiment is conducted, evaluating various classification techniques applied on eleven real-life data sets from telecom operators worldwide by using both the profit centric and statistically based performance measures. The experimental results show that a small number of variables suffices to predict churn with high accuracy, and that oversampling generally does not improve the performance significantly. Finally, a large group of classifiers is found to yield comparable performance. }

Among the mining approaches, finding temporal patterns and regularities is very important due to its practicality. In the past, Hong et al. proposed the up-to-date patterns, which were frequent within their up-to-date lifetime. Formally, an up-to-date pattern is a pair with the itemset and its valid corresponding lifetime in which the user-defined minimum support threshold must be satisfied. They also proposed an Apriori-like approach to find the up-to-date patterns. This paper thus proposes the up-to-date pattern tree (UDP tree) to keep the up-to-date 1-patterns in a tree structure for reducing database scan. It is similar to the FP-tree structure but more complex due to the requirement of up-to-date patterns. The UDP-growth mining approach is also designed to find the up-to-date patterns from the \{UDP\} tree. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better performance than the level-wise mining algorithm. }

While there are a number of business process management (BPM) and business process simulation (BPS) methodologies, approaches and tools available, it is more desirable to have a systemic \{BPS\} approach for operational decision support, from constructing process models based on historical data to simulating processes for typical and common problems. In this paper, we have proposed a generic approach of \{BPS\} for operational decision support which includes business processes modeling and workflow simulation with the models generated. Processes are modeled with event graphs through process mining from workflow logs that have integrated comprehensive information about the control-flow, data and resource aspects of a business process. A case study of a credit card application is presented to illustrate the steps involved in constructing an event graph. The evaluation detail is also given in terms of precision, generalization and robustness. Based on the event graph model constructed, we simulate the process under different scenarios and analyze the simulation logs for three generic problems in the case study: 1) suitable resource allocation plan for different case arrival rates; 2) teamwork performance under different case arrival rates; and 3) evaluation and prediction for personal performances. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to model business processes using event graphs and simulate the processes for common operational decision support which collectively play an important role in process management and improvement. }

Emotion could be also considered as a “positive or negative experience” that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity. So, the extraction and recognition of emotions from multimedia contents is becoming one of the most challenging research topics in human–computer interaction. Facial expressions, posture, gestures, speech, emotive changes of physical parameters (e.g. body temperature, blush and changes in the tone of the voice) can reflect changes in the user׳s emotional state and all this kind of parameters can be detected and interpreted by a computer leading to the so-called “affective computing”. In this paper an approach for the extraction of emotions from images and videos will be introduced. In particular, it involves the adoption of action units׳ extraction from facial expression according to the Ekman theory. The proposed approach has been tested on standard and real datasets with interesting and promising results. }

However, the constant growth of data volume in remote sensing imaging makes reaching conclusions based on collected data a challenging task. Recently, data mining appears to be a promising research field leading to several interesting discoveries in various areas such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery. By integrating data mining and image interpretation techniques, accurate and relevant information (i.e. functional relation between observed parcels and a set of informational contents) can be automatically elicited. This study presents a new approach to predict spatiotemporal changes in satellite image databases. The proposed method exploits fuzzy sets and data mining concepts to build predictions and decisions for several remote sensing fields. It takes into account imperfections related to the spatiotemporal mining process in order to provide more accurate and reliable information about land cover changes in satellite images. The proposed approach is validated using \{SPOT\} images representing the Saint-Denis region, capital of Reunion Island. Results show good performances of the proposed framework in predicting change for the urban zone. }

  abstract = {The field of data mining has become accustomed to specifying constraints on patterns of interest. A large number of systems and techniques has been developed for solving such constraint-based mining problems, especially for mining itemsets. The approach taken in the field of data mining contrasts with the constraint programming principles developed within the artificial intelligence community. While most data mining research focuses on algorithmic issues and aims at developing highly optimized and scalable implementations that are tailored towards specific tasks, constraint programming employs a more declarative approach. The emphasis lies on developing high-level modeling languages and general solvers that specify what the problem is, rather than outlining how a solution should be computed, yet are powerful enough to be used across a wide variety of applications and application domains. This paper contributes a declarative constraint programming approach to data mining. More specifically, we show that it is possible to employ off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques for modeling and solving a wide variety of constraint-based itemset mining tasks, such as frequent, closed, discriminative, and cost-based itemset mining. In particular, we develop a basic constraint programming model for specifying frequent itemsets and show that this model can easily be extended to realize the other settings. This contrasts with typical procedural data mining systems where the underlying procedures need to be modified in order to accommodate new types of constraint, or novel combinations thereof. Even though the performance of state-of-the-art data mining systems outperforms that of the constraint programming approach on some standard tasks, we also show that there exist problems where the constraint programming approach leads to significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in data mining and as well as to new insights into the underlying data mining problems. Many such insights can be obtained by relating the underlying search algorithms of data mining and constraint programming systems to one another. We discuss a number of interesting new research questions and challenges raised by the declarative constraint programming approach to data mining. }

  abstract = {k nearest neighbor (kNN) is an effective and powerful lazy learning algorithm, notwithstanding its easy-to-implement. However, its performance heavily relies on the quality of training data. Due to many complex real-applications, noises coming from various possible sources are often prevalent in large scale databases. How to eliminate anomalies and improve the quality of data is still a challenge. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a new anomaly removal and learning algorithm under the framework of kNN. The primary characteristic of our method is that the evidence of removing anomalies and predicting class labels of unseen instances is mutual nearest neighbors, rather than k nearest neighbors. The advantage is that pseudo nearest neighbors can be identified and will not be taken into account during the prediction process. Consequently, the final learning result is more creditable. An extensive comparative experimental analysis carried out on \{UCI\} datasets provided empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing the performance of the k-NN rule. }

Neural networks, support vector machines, and other algorithms often fit data well, but because of lack of comprehensibility, they are considered black box technologies. Conversely, decision trees are more comprehensible by human users. However, sometimes far too many rules result in another form of incomprehensibility. The number of rules obtained from decision tree algorithms can be controlled to some degree through setting different minimum support levels. This study applies a variety of data mining tools to bankruptcy data, with the purpose of comparing accuracy and number of rules. For this data, decision trees were found to be relatively more accurate compared to neural networks and support vector machines, but there were more rule nodes than desired. Adjustment of minimum support yielded more tractable rule sets. }

Linking the context to the text data can provide valuable information regarding users' activities and preferences, which are useful for decision support tasks such as market segmentation and product recommendation. To this end, previous studies have proposed to incorporate into topic models contextual information such as authors' identities and timestamps. Despite recent efforts to incorporate contextual information, few studies have focused on the short-term cyclical topic dynamics that connect the changes in topic occurrences to the time of day, the day of the week, and the day of the month. Short-term cyclical topic dynamics can both characterize the typical contexts to which a user is exposed at different occasions and identify user habits in specific contexts. Both abilities are essential for decision support tasks that are context dependent. To address this challenge, we present the Probit-Dirichlet hybrid allocation (PDHA) topic model, which incorporates a document's temporal features to capture a topic's short-term cyclical dynamics. A document's temporal features enter the topic model through the regression covariates of a multinomial-Probit-like structure that influences the prior topic distribution of individual tokens. By incorporating temporal features for monthly, weekly, and daily cyclical dynamics, \{PDHA\} is able to capture interesting short-term cyclical patterns that characterize topic dynamics. We developed an augmented Gibbs sampling algorithm for the non-Dirichlet-conjugate setting in PDHA. We then demonstrated the utility of \{PDHA\} using text collections from user generated content, newswires, and newspapers. Our experiments show that \{PDHA\} achieves higher hold-out likelihood values compared to baseline models, including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Dirichlet-multinomial regression (DMR). The temporal features for short-term cyclical dynamics and the novel model structure of \{PDHA\} both contribute to this performance advantage. The results suggest that \{PDHA\} is an attractive approach for decision support tasks involving text mining. }

Extraction and exploration of methodological information, in particular, requires systematic understanding of the literature, but in many cases is performed within a limited context of publications that can be manually reviewed by an individual or group. Automated methodology identification could provide an opportunity for systematic retrieval of relevant documents and for exploring developments within a given discipline. In this paper we present a system for the identification of methodology mentions in scientific publications in the area of natural language processing, and in particular in automatic terminology recognition. The system comprises two major layers: the first layer is an automatic identification of methodological sentences; the second layer highlights methodological phrases (segments). Each mention is categorised in four semantic categories: Task, Method, Resource/Feature and Implementation. Extraction and classification of the segments is formalised as a sequence tagging problem and four separate phrase-based Conditional Random Fields are used to accomplish the task. The system has been evaluated on a manually annotated corpus comprising 45 full text articles. The results for the segment level annotation show an F-measure of 53% for identification of Task and Method mentions (with 70% precision), whereas the F-measures for Resource/Feature and Implementation identification were 61% (with 67% precision) and 75% (with 86% precision) respectively. At the document-level, an F-measure of 72% (with 81% precision) for Task mentions, 60% (with 81% precision) for Method mentions, 74% (with 78% precision) for the Resource/Feature and 79% (with 81% precision) for the Implementation categories have been achieved. We provide a detailed analysis of errors and explore the impact that the particular groups of features have on the extraction of methodological segments. }

  abstract = {AbstractIntroduction The ambiguity of biomedical abbreviations is one of the challenges in biomedical text mining systems. In particular, the handling of term variants and abbreviations without nearby definitions is a critical issue. In this study, we adopt the concepts of topic of document and word link to disambiguate biomedical abbreviations. Methods We newly suggest the link topic model inspired by the latent Dirichlet allocation model, in which each document is perceived as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. Thus, the most probable expansions with respect to abbreviations of a given abstract are determined by word-topic, document-topic, and word-link distributions estimated from a document collection through the link topic model. The model allows two distinct modes of word generation to incorporate semantic dependencies among words, particularly long form words of abbreviations and their sentential co-occurring words; a word can be generated either dependently on the long form of the abbreviation or independently. The semantic dependency between two words is defined as a link and a new random parameter for the link is assigned to each word as well as a topic parameter. Because the link status indicates whether the word constitutes a link with a given specific long form, it has the effect of determining whether a word forms a unigram or a skipping/consecutive bigram with respect to the long form. Furthermore, we place a constraint on the model so that a word has the same topic as a specific long form if it is generated in reference to the long form. Consequently, documents are generated from the two hidden parameters, i.e. topic and link, and the most probable expansion of a specific abbreviation is estimated from the parameters. Results Our model relaxes the bag-of-words assumption of the standard topic model in which the word order is neglected, and it captures a richer structure of text than does the standard topic model by considering unigrams and semantically associated bigrams simultaneously. The addition of semantic links improves the disambiguation accuracy without removing irrelevant contextual words and reduces the parameter space of massive skipping or consecutive bigrams. The link topic model achieves 98.42% disambiguation accuracy on 73,505 \{MEDLINE\} abstracts with respect to 21 three letter abbreviations and their 139 distinct long forms. }

Although financial fraud detection (FFD) is an emerging topic of great importance, a comprehensive literature review of the subject has yet to be carried out. This paper thus represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of the data mining techniques that have been applied to FFD. 49 journal articles on the subject published between 1997 and 2008 was analyzed and classified into four categories of financial fraud (bank fraud, insurance fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other related financial fraud) and six classes of data mining techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The findings of this review clearly show that data mining techniques have been applied most extensively to the detection of insurance fraud, although corporate fraud and credit card fraud have also attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In contrast, we find a distinct lack of research on mortgage fraud, money laundering, and securities and commodities fraud. The main data mining techniques used for \{FFD\} are logistic models, neural networks, the Bayesian belief network, and decision trees, all of which provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data. This paper also addresses the gaps between \{FFD\} and the needs of the industry to encourage additional research on neglected topics, and concludes with several suggestions for further \{FFD\} research. }

The proposed approach integrates the previous two-phase procedure for utility mining and the FP-tree concept to utilize the downward-closure property and generate a compressed tree structure. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach has a better performance than Liu et al.’s two-phase algorithm in execution time. At last, the numbers of tree nodes generated from three different item ordering methods are also compared, with results showing that the frequency ordering produces less tree nodes than the other two. }

  abstract = {In this paper a new class of reservoir models that are developed based on the pattern recognition technologies collectively known as Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (AI&amp;DM) is introduced. The workflows developed based on this new class of reservoir simulation and modeling tools break new ground in modeling fluid flow through porous media by providing a completely new and different angle on reservoir simulation and modeling. The philosophy behind this modeling approach and its major commonalities and differences with numerical and analytical models are explored and two different categories of such models are explained. Details of this technology are presented using examples of most recent applications to several prolific reservoirs in the Middle East and in the Gulf of Mexico. AI-based Reservoir Models can be developed for green or brown fields. Since these models are developed based on spatio-temporal databases that are specifically developed for this purpose, they require the existence of a basic numerical reservoir simulator for the green fields while can be developed entirely based on historical data for brown fields. The run-time of AI-based Reservoir Models that provide complete field responses is measured in seconds rather than hours and days (even for a multi-million grid block reservoir). Therefore, providing means for fast track reservoir analysis and AI-assisted history matching are intrinsic characteristics of these models. AI-based Reservoir Models can, in some cases, completely substitute numerical reservoir simulation models, work side by side but completely independent or be integrated with them in order to increase their productivity. Advantages associated with AI-based Reservoir Models are short development time, low development cost, fast track analysis and practical capability to quantify the uncertainties associated with the static model. AI-based Reservoir Model includes a novel design tool for comprehensive analysis of the full field and design of field development strategies to meet operational targets. They have open data requirement architecture that can accommodate a wide variety of data from pressure tests to seismic. }

  abstract = {Digital data collected for forensics analysis often contain valuable information about the suspects’ social networks. However, most collected records are in the form of unstructured textual data, such as e-mails, chat messages, and text documents. An investigator often has to manually extract the useful information from the text and then enter the important pieces into a structured database for further investigation by using various criminal network analysis tools. Obviously, this information extraction process is tedious and error-prone. Moreover, the quality of the analysis varies by the experience and expertise of the investigator. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to discover criminal networks from a collection of text documents obtained from a suspect’s machine, extract useful information for investigation, and then visualize the suspect’s criminal network. Furthermore, we present a hypothesis generation approach to identify potential indirect relationships among the members in the identified networks. We evaluated the effectiveness and performance of the method on a real-life cybercrimine case and some other datasets. The proposed method, together with the implemented software tool, has received positive feedback from the digital forensics team of a law enforcement unit in Canada. }

Dividing large, multiple topic spanning documents into sets of coherent subdocuments facilitates the information retrieval process. This paper presents a novel technique to automatically subdivide a textual document into consistent components based on a coherence quantification function. This function is based on stem or term chains linking document entities, such as sentences or paragraphs, based on the reoccurrences of stems or terms. Applying this function on a document results in a coherence graph of the document linking its entities. Spectral graph partitioning techniques are used to divide this coherence graph into a number of subdocuments. A novel technique is introduced to obtain the most suitable number of subdocuments. These subdocuments are an aggregation of (not necessarily adjacent) entities. Performance tests are conducted in test environments based on standardized datasets to prove the algorithm’s capabilities. The relevance of these techniques for information retrieval and text mining is discussed. }

Although many approaches have been offered to support resource allocation, they are not sufficient to derive interesting resource allocation rules which ensure that each activity is performed by suitable resource. Hence, this paper introduces an association rule mining based approach to mine interesting resource allocation rules from event log. The idea is to concern the ordered correlations between items in event log, and then to present two efficient algorithms to mine real “interesting” rules. The event log of radiology CT-scan examination process provided by the Chinese Huzhou hospital is used to verify the proposed approach. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach not only is able to extract the rules more efficient and much faster, but also can discover more important resource allocation rules. }

In this study, an extensive review covering the literature from 1997 to 2007 and several analyses on selected quality tasks are provided on \{DM\} applications in the manufacturing industry. The quality tasks considered are; product/process quality description, predicting quality, classification of quality, and parameter optimisation. The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature from various points of view: data handling practices, \{DM\} applications for each quality task and for each manufacturing industry, patterns in the use of \{DM\} methods, application results, and software used in the applications are analysed. Several summary tables and figures are also provided along with the discussion of the analyses and results. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are presented. }

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the architecture of the system under development the purpose of which is to capture the sentiment of web users regarding any topic such as retail products, financial instruments (FI), or social issues like immigration. The first step is knowledge acquisition. A Sentiment Web Mining (SWM) system requires acquisition of knowledge from several sources on the web. Such knowledge may be found on blogs, social networks, email, or online news. A \{SWM\} system has customization and personalization capabilities. For our purposes, customization occurs when the \{SWM\} user can change his/her preferences to select specific sites to be used for data mining and evaluation. Personalization occurs when the system decides which sites to be used for data mining based on the user profile. The user profile dynamically changes depending on the type of user request from the system and the specific sites the user visits to verify the result of the \{SWM\} system. The second step is knowledge storage, which involves the creation of a database. Appropriate web sites will be indexed and tagged. Taxonomy is the hardest part of this step. In this paper we will demonstrate a unique way of tagging the knowledge obtained from the web. The third step is the knowledge analysis/data mining. A \{SWM\} system will use a series of off–the-shelf knowledge analysis/data mining tools including \{SWM\} knowledge analysis/data mining engine which is based on web services technology. The type of questions used can be: 1) The volume of sentiment for a particular topic; 2) The intensity of sentiment (good or bad) for a particular topic; 3) The interrelationship between the writers of material written on the web, especially if the writer is anonymous; 4) Who is/are the leader(s) of the sentiment? If the information is maliciously posted on the web the user may want to pursue it through legal means.The last step is dissemination of knowledge to the user(s). A \{SWM\} system uses third party visualization tools as well as web based user interfaces and reports that are written internally. The presentation component of a \{SWM\} system is decoupled from other components, namely, the process component, business rule component, and data access component for ease of maintainability. }

As the field continues to expand, we generate a great deal of data about all aspects, and from multiple perspectives, of the brain, its chemistry, biology, and how these affect behavior. The vast majority of research scientists cannot afford to spend their time combing the literature to find every article related to their research, nor do they wish to spend time adjusting their neuroanatomical vocabulary to communicate with other subdomains in the neurosciences. As such, there has been a recent increase in the amount of informatics research devoted to developing digital resources for neuroscience research. Neuroinformatics is concerned with the development of computational tools to further our understanding of the brain and to make sense of the vast amount of information that neuroscientists generate (French &amp; Pavlidis, 2007). Many of these tools are related to the use of textual data. Here, we review some of the recent developments for better using the vast amount of textual information generated in neuroscience research and publication and suggest several use cases that will demonstrate how bench neuroscientists can take advantage of the resources that are available. }

However, Web traversal patterns obtained by traditional Web usage mining approaches are ineffective for the content management of websites. They do not provide the big picture of the intentions of the visitors. The Web navigation patterns, termed throughout-surfing patterns (TSPs) as defined in this paper, are a superset of Web traversal patterns that effectively display the trends toward the next visited Web pages in a browsing session. \{TSPs\} are more expressive for understanding the purposes of website visitors. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of throughout-surfing patterns and then present an efficient method for mining the patterns. We propose a compact graph structure, termed a path traversal graph, to record information about the navigation paths of website visitors. The graph contains the frequent surfing paths that are required for mining TSPs. In addition, we devised a graph traverse algorithm based on the proposed graph structure to discover the TSPs. The experimental results show the proposed mining method is highly efficient to discover TSPs. }

Here we present a method to prioritize novel candidates of disease-susceptibility genes depending on the biological similarities to the known disease-related genes. The extent of disease-susceptibility of a gene is prioritized by analyzing seven features of human genes captured in H-InvDB. Taking rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and prostate cancer (PC) as two examples, we evaluated the efficiency of our method. Highly scored genes obtained included \{TNFSF12\} and \{OSM\} as candidate disease genes for \{RA\} and PC, respectively. Subsequent characterization of these genes based upon an extensive literature survey reinforced the validity of these highly scored genes as possible disease-susceptibility genes. Our approach, Prioritization \{ANalysis\} of Disease Association (PANDA), is an efficient and cost-effective method to narrow down a large set of genes into smaller subsets that are most likely to be involved in the disease pathogenesis. }

Settings such as, e.g., the cooling factor in simulated annealing, may greatly affect a metaheuristic’s efficiency as well as effectiveness in solving a given decision problem. However, procedures for organizing parameter calibration are scarce and commonly limited to particular metaheuristics. We argue that the parameter selection task can appropriately be addressed by means of a data mining based approach. In particular, a hybrid system is devised, which employs regression models to learn suitable parameter values from past moves of a metaheuristic in an online fashion. In order to identify a suitable regression method and, more generally, to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study of particle swarm optimization is conducted. Empirical results suggest that characteristics of the decision problem as well as search history data indeed embody information that allows suitable parameter values to be determined, and that this type of information can successfully be extracted by means of nonlinear regression models. }

The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of a large number of root canal treatments conducted in general practice. Methods The data was collected from the digital database of a major German national health insurance company. All teeth with complete treatment data were included. Only patients who had been insurance members for the whole 3-year period from 2010 to 2012 were eligible. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were conducted based on completed root canal treatments. Target events were re-interventions as (1) retreatment of the root canal treatment, (2) apical root resection (apicoectomy) and (3) extraction. The influences of vitality status and root numbers on survival were tested with the log-rank test. Results A total of 556,067 root canal treatments were included. The cumulative overall survival rate for all target events combined was 84.3% for 3 years. The survival rate for nonvital teeth (82.6%) was significantly lower than for vital teeth (85.6%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). The survival rate for single rooted teeth (83.4%) was significantly lower than for multi-rooted teeth (85.5%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). The most frequent target event was extraction followed by apical root resection and retreatment. Conclusions Based on these 3-year outcomes, root canal treatment is considered a reliable treatment in practice routine under the conditions of the German national health insurance system. Clinical significance Root canal treatment can be considered as a reliable treatment option suitable to salvage most of the affected teeth. This statement applies to treatments that in the vast majority of cases were delivered by general practitioners under the terms and conditions of a nationwide health insurance system. }

  abstract = {Background Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has played an important role in the fields of psychiatry, neurology and neuroscience, since its emergence in the mid-1980s; and several high quality reviews have been produced since then. Most high quality reviews serve as powerful tools in the evaluation of predefined tendencies, but they cannot actually uncover new trends within the literature. However, special statistical procedures to ‘mine’ the literature have been developed which aid in achieving such a goal. Objectives This paper aims to uncover patterns within the literature on \{TMS\} as a whole, as well as specific trends in the recent literature on \{TMS\} for the treatment of depression. Methods Data mining and text mining. Results Currently there are 7299 publications, which can be clustered in four essential themes. Considering the frequency of the core psychiatric concepts within the indexed literature, the main results are: depression is present in 13.5% of the publications; Parkinson's disease in 2.94%; schizophrenia in 2.76%; bipolar disorder in 0.158%; and anxiety disorder in 0.142% of all the publications indexed in PubMed. Several other perspectives are discussed in the article. }

In this paper, we propose an approach to extract a hot spot of a given topic in a time-stamped document set. Topics can be basic, containing a simple list of keywords, or complex. Logical relationships such as and, or, and not are used to build complex topics from basic topics. A concept of presence measure of a topic based on fuzzy set theory is introduced to compute the amount of information related to the topic in the document set. Each interval in the time period of the document set is associated with a numeric value which we call the discrepancy score. A high discrepancy score indicates that the documents in the time interval are more focused on the topic than those outside of the time interval. A hot spot of a given topic is defined as a time interval with the highest discrepancy score. We first describe a naive implementation for extracting hot spots. We then construct an algorithm called \{EHE\} (Efficient Hot Spot Extraction) using several efficient strategies to improve performance. We also introduce the notion of a topic \{DAG\} to facilitate an efficient computation of presence measures of complex topics. The proposed approach is illustrated by several experiments on a subset of the TDT-Pilot Corpus and \{DBLP\} conference data set. The experiments show that the proposed \{EHE\} algorithm significantly outperforms the naive one, and the extracted hot spots of given topics are meaningful. }

This paper provides empirical results from an industrial case study, carried out on an automotive machining line, in order to explain the \{SBI\} procedure.

Depending on the system load of the line, different decision variables have been found to be influencing. How the \{SBI\} method is used to find important patterns in the explored solution set and how it can be valuable to support decision making in order to improve the scheduling under different system loadings in the machining line are addressed. }

It must support heterogeneous distributed incident data, allow decision makers (DMs) to detect anomalies and extract useful knowledge, assist \{DMs\} in evaluating the risks and selecting an appropriate alternative during an incident, and provide differentiated services to satisfy the requirements of different incident management phases. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an incident information management framework that consists of three major components. The first component is a high-level data integration module in which heterogeneous data sources are integrated and presented in a uniform format. The second component is a data mining module that uses data mining methods to identify useful patterns and presents a process to provide differentiated services for pre-incident and post-incident information management. The third component is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) module that utilizes \{MCDM\} methods to assess the current situation, find the satisfactory solutions, and take appropriate responses in a timely manner. To validate the proposed framework, this paper conducts a case study on agrometeorological disasters that occurred in China between 1997 and 2001. The case study demonstrates that the combination of data mining and \{MCDM\} methods can provide objective and comprehensive assessments of incident risks. }

Ultimately one can even discover new knowledge by screening research databases. Once one determines the value in mining external R&amp;D, tough issues remain to be overcome. Technology management has developed a culture that relies more on intuition than on evidence. Changing that culture and implementing effective technical intelligence capabilities is worth the effort.

Compared to its bacterial counterpart which encompasses 14–17 subunits, mitochondrial complex I has almost tripled its subunit composition during evolution of eukaryotes, by recruitment of so-called accessory subunits, part of them being specific to distinct evolutionary lineages. The increasing availability of numerous broadly sampled eukaryotic genomes now enables the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this large protein complex. Here, a combination of profile-based sequence comparisons and basic structural properties analyses at the protein level enabled to pinpoint homology relationships between complex I subunits from fungi, mammals or green plants, previously identified as subunits. In addition, homologs of at least 40 mammalian complex I subunits are present in representatives of all major eukaryote assemblages, half of them having not been investigated so far (Excavates, Chromalveolates, Amoebozoa). This analysis revealed that complex I was subject to a phenomenal increase in size that predated the diversification of extant eukaryotes, followed by very few lineage-specific additions/losses of subunits. The implications of this subunit conservation for studies of complex I are discussed. }

The resources come from a variety of repositories maintained by organizations from around the world. We use a set of over 200 publicly available ontologies contributed by researchers in various domains to annotate the elements in these resources. We use the semantics that the ontologies encode, such as different properties of classes, the class hierarchies, and the mappings between ontologies, in order to improve the search experience for the Resource Index user. Our user interface enables scientists to search the multiple resources quickly and efficiently using domain terms, without even being aware that there is semantics “under the hood.” }

Furthermore, a client–server architecture is employed which has the dual purpose of guaranteeing the privacy of personal data and greatly reducing the computational load on mobile devices. An evaluation using a corpus of trajectory data from 17 people demonstrates that \{CRPM\} can extract longer route patterns than current methods. Moreover, the average correct rate of one step prediction of our system is greater than 71%, and the average Levenshtein distance of continuous route prediction of our system is about 30% shorter than that of the Markov model based method. }

  abstract = {Objective The paper addresses the problem of finding visual patterns in histology image collections. In particular, it proposes a method for correlating basic visual patterns with high-level concepts combining an appropriate image collection representation with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Methodology The proposed method starts by representing the visual content of the collection using a bag-of-features strategy. Then, two main visual mining tasks are performed: finding associations between visual-patterns and high-level concepts, and performing automatic image annotation. Associations are found using minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection and co-clustering analysis. Annotation is done by applying a support-vector-machine classifier. Additionally, the proposed method includes an interpretation mechanism that associates concept annotations with corresponding image regions. The method was evaluated in two data sets: one comprising histology images from the different four fundamental tissues, and the other composed of histopathology images used for cancer diagnosis. Different visual-word representations and codebook sizes were tested. The performance in both concept association and image annotation tasks was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Results The results show that the method is able to find highly discriminative visual features and to associate them to high-level concepts. In the annotation task the method showed a competitive performance: an increase of 21% in f-measure with respect to the baseline in the histopathology data set, and an increase of 47% in the histology data set. Conclusions The experimental evidence suggests that the bag-of-features representation is a good alternative to represent visual content in histology images. The proposed method exploits this representation to perform visual pattern mining from a wider perspective where the focus is the image collection as a whole, rather than individual images. }

  abstract = {Time series is an important class of temporal data objects and it can be easily obtained from scientific and financial applications. A time series is a collection of observations made chronologically. The nature of time series data includes: large in data size, high dimensionality and necessary to update continuously. Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical field. The increasing use of time series data has initiated a great deal of research and development attempts in the field of data mining. The abundant research on time series data mining in the last decade could hamper the entry of interested researchers, due to its complexity. In this paper, a comprehensive revision on the existing time series data mining research is given. They are generally categorized into representation and indexing, similarity measure, segmentation, visualization and mining. Moreover state-of-the-art research issues are also highlighted. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a glossary for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current time series data mining development and identify their potential research direction to further investigation. }

In this paper, we propose methods for enhancing features using topic models, which make short text seem less sparse and more topic-oriented for classification. We exploited topic model analysis based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation for enriched datasets, and then we presented new methods for enhancing features by combining external texts from topic models that make documents more effective for classification. In experiments, we utilized the title contents of scientific articles as short text documents, and then enriched these documents using topic models from various types of universal datasets for classification in order to show that our approach performs efficiently. }

We describe a method, called PolyA-iEP, that we developed for predicting polyadenylation sites and we present a systematic study of the problem of recognizing mRNA 3′ ends which contain a polyadenylation site using the proposed method. PolyA-iEP is a modular system consisting of two main components that both contribute substantially to the descriptive and predictive potential of the system. In specific, PolyA-iEP exploits the advantages of emerging patterns, namely high understandability and discriminating power and the strength of a distance-based scoring method that we propose. The extracted emerging patterns may span across many elements around the polyadenylation site and can provide novel and interesting biological insights. The outputs of these two components are finally combined by a classifier in a highly effective framework, which in our setup reaches 93.7% of sensitivity and 88.2% of specificity. PolyA-iEP can be parameterized and used for both descriptive and predictive analysis. We have experimented with Arabidopsis thaliana sequences for evaluating our method and we have drawn important conclusions. }

Based on such fighters’ behaviors patterns, we explore the data structures used to store and the satisfied properties used to mine; and further, by designing and implementing the relevant mining/processing algorithms and systems, we have discovered some experience patterns of the fighters’ behaviors and have conducted certain valid predictions for the fighters’ behaviors.

How to alleviate this problem is the main concern of research on natural language processing, especially multi-document summarization. With the aim of seeking a new method to help justify the importance of similar sentences in multi-document summarizations, this study proposes a novel approach based on recent hierarchical Bayesian topic models. The proposed model incorporates the concepts of n-grams into hierarchically latent topics to capture the word dependencies that appear in the local context of a word. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that this model has outperformed both hLDA and \{LDA\} in document modeling. In addition, the experimental results in practice demonstrate that our summarization system implementing this model can significantly improve the performance and make it comparable to the state-of-the-art summarization systems. }

It is important to establish an effective early warning system for prediction of financial crisis for better corporate governance. This paper studies the phenomenon of financial distress for 107 Chinese companies that received the label ‘special treatment’ from 2001 to 2008 by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We use data mining techniques to build financial distress warning models based on 31 financial indicators and three different time windows by comparing these 107 firms to a control group of firms. We observe that the performance of neural networks is more accurate than other classifiers, such as decision trees and support vector machines, as well as an ensemble of multiple classifiers combined using majority voting. An important contribution of the paper is to discover that financial indicators, such as net profit margin of total assets, return on total assets, earnings per share, and cash flow per share, play an important role in prediction of deterioration in profitability. This paper provides a suitable method for prediction of financial distress for listed companies in China. }

However, such directories are generally constructed manually and may have disadvantages of narrow coverage and inconsistency. Besides, most of existing directories provide only monolingual hierarchies that organized Web pages in terms that a user may not be familiar with. In this work, we will propose an approach that could automatically arrange multilingual Web pages into a multilingual Web directory to break the language barriers in Web navigation. In this approach, a self-organizing map is constructed to train each set of monolingual Web pages and obtain two feature maps, which reveal the relationships among Web pages and thematic keywords, respectively, for such language. We then apply a hierarchy generation process on these maps to obtain the monolingual hierarchy for these Web pages. A hierarchy alignment method is then applied on these monolingual hierarchies to discover the associations between nodes in different hierarchies. Finally, a multilingual Web directory is constructed according to such associations. We applied the proposed approach on a set of Web pages and obtained interesting result that demonstrates the feasibility of our method in multilingual Web navigation. }

To leverage the collective knowledge of travelers for destination summarization, in this paper we propose a framework which discovers location-representative tags from travelogues and then select relevant and representative photos to visualize these tags. The learnt tags and selected photos are finally organized appropriately to provide an informative summary which describes a given destination both textually and visually. Experimental results based on a large collection of travelogues and photos show promising results on destination summarization. }

To realize the processing, we use methods from text mining and text classification (tokenization, term filtering methods, Euclidean distance measure etc.) and combine them with a new heuristic measure for mining ideas. As a result, the idea mining approach extracts automatically new and useful ideas from an user given text.

There are many scenarios where it is useful to have reliable time predictions. For example, when a customer phones her insurance company for information about her insurance claim, she can be given an estimate for the remaining processing time. In order to do this, we provide a configurable approach to construct a process model, augment this model with time information learned from earlier instances, and use this to predict e.g., the completion time. To provide meaningful time predictions we use a configurable set of abstractions that allow for a good balance between “overfitting” and “underfitting”. The approach has been implemented in ProM and through several experiments using real-life event logs we demonstrate its applicability. }

The optimization involves selecting appropriate false-alarm detection tradeoffs (operating points) for each classifier to minimize an end-to-end misclassification penalty, while satisfying resource constraints. We design distributed solutions, by defining tree configuration games, where individual classifiers configure themselves to maximize an appropriate local utility. We define the local utility functions and determine the information that needs to be exchanged across classifiers in order to design the distributed solutions. We analytically show that there is a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium in operating points, which guarantees convergence of the proposed approach. We develop both myopic strategy, where the utility is purely local to the current classifier, and foresighted strategy, where the utility includes impact of classifier’s actions on successive classifiers. We analytically show that actions determined based on foresighted strategies improve the end-to-end performance of the classifier tree, by deriving an associated probability bound. We also investigate the impact of resource constraints on the classifier action selections for each strategy, and the corresponding application performance. We propose a learning-based approach, which enables each classifier to effectively adapt to the dynamic changes of resource constraints. We evaluate the performance of our solutions on an application for sports scene classification. We show that foresighted strategies result in better performance than myopic strategies in both resource unconstrained and resource constrained scenarios, and asymptotically approach the centralized optimal solution. We also show that the proposed distributed solutions outperform the centralized solution based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming on average in resource unconstrained scenarios. }

  abstract = {Because of the varying and dynamic characteristics of network traffic, such as fast transfer, huge volume, shot-lived, inestimable and infinite, it is a serious challenge for network administrators to monitor network traffic in real time and judge whether the whole network works well. Currently, most of the existing techniques in this area are based on signature training, learning or matching, which may be too complicated to satisfy timely requirements. Other statistical methods including sampling, hashing or counting are all approximate methods and compute an incomplete set of results. Since the main objective of network monitoring is to discover and understand the active events that happen frequently and may influence or even ruin the total network. So in the paper we aim to use the technique of frequent pattern mining to find out these events. We first design a sliding window model to make sure the mining result novel and integrated; then, under the consideration of the distribution and fluidity of network flows, we develop a powerful class of algorithms that contains vertical re-mining algorithm, multi-pattern re-mining algorithm, fast multi-pattern capturing algorithm and fast multi-pattern capturing supplement algorithm to deal with a series of problems when applying frequent pattern mining algorithm in network traffic analysis. Finally, we develop a monitoring system to evaluate our algorithms on real traces collected from the campus network of Peking University. The results show that some given algorithms are effective enough and our system can definitely identify a lot of potentially very valuable information in time which greatly help network administrators to understand regular applications and detect network anomalies. So the research in this paper not only provides a new application area for frequent pattern mining, but also provides a new technique for network monitoring. }

With the emergence of new applications, the data we process are not again static, but the continuous dynamic data stream. Examples include network traffic analysis, Web click stream mining, network intrusion detection, and on-line transaction analysis. In this paper, we propose a new framework for data stream mining, called the weighted sliding window model. The proposed model allows the user to specify the number of windows for mining, the size of a window, and the weight for each window. Thus users can specify a higher weight to a more significant data section, which will make the mining result closer to user’s requirements. Based on the weighted sliding window model, we propose a single pass algorithm, called WSW, to efficiently discover all the frequent itemsets from data streams. By analyzing data characteristics, an improved algorithm, called WSW-Imp, is developed to further reduce the time of deciding whether a candidate itemset is frequent or not. Empirical results show that WSW-Imp outperforms \{WSW\} under the weighted sliding window model. }

  abstract = {Abstract Mass classification is one of the key procedures in mammography computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, which is widely applied to help improving clinic diagnosis performance. In literature, classical mass classification systems always employ a large number and types of features for discriminating masses. This will produce higher computational complexity. And the incompatibility among various features also may introduce some negative impact to classification accuracy. Furthermore, latent characteristics of masses are seldom considered in the present scheme, which are useful to reveal hidden distribution pattern of masses. For the above purpose, the paper proposes a new mammographic mass classification scheme. Mammograms are detected and segmented first for obtaining region of interests with masses (ROIms). Then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is introduced to find hidden topic distribution of ROIms. A special spatial pyramid structure is proposed and incorporated with \{LDA\} for capturing latent spatial characteristics of ROIms. For mining latent statistical marginal characteristics of masses, local patches on segmented boundary are extracted to construct a special document for LDA. Finally, all the latent topics will be combined, analyzed and classified by employing the \{SVM\} classifier. The experimental results on a dataset in \{DDSM\} demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classification scheme. }

The redundancy in association rules affects the quality of the information presented. The goal of redundancy elimination is to improve the quality and usefulness of the rules. Our work aims is to remove hierarchical duplicacy in multi-level, thus reducing the size of the rule set to improve the quality and usefulness without any loss. }

In this study, we proposed a novel graphical model to extract and visualize comparative relations between products from customer reviews, with the interdependencies among relations taken into consideration, to help enterprises discover potential risks and further design new products and marketing strategies.

In this paper, we develop two supervised topic models for multi-label classification problems. The two models, i.e., Frequency-LDA (FLDA) and Dependency-Frequency-LDA (DFLDA), extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) via two observations, i.e., the frequencies of the labels and the dependencies among different labels. We train the models by the Gibbs sampler algorithm. The experiment results on well known collections demonstrate that our two models outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. }

While summative assessment is a typically formal assessment used at the end of a lesson or course, formative assessment is an ongoing process of monitoring learners’ progresses of knowledge construction. Although empirical evidence has acknowledged that formal assessment is indeed superior to summative assessment, current e-learning assessment systems however seldom provide plausible solutions for conducting formative assessment. The major bottleneck of putting formative assessment into practice lies in its labor-intensive and time-consuming nature, which makes it hardly a feasible way of achievement evaluation especially when there are usually a large number of learners in e-learning environment. In this regard, this study developed EduMiner to relieve the burdens imposed on instructors and learners by capitalizing a series of text mining techniques. An empirical study was held to examine effectiveness and to explore outcomes of the features that EduMiner supported. In this study 56 participants enrolling in a “Human Resource Management” course were randomly divided into either experimental groups or control groups. Results of this study indicated that the algorithms introduced in this study serve as a feasible approach for conducting formative assessment in e-learning environment. In addition, learners in experimental groups were highly motivated to phrase the contents with higher-order level of cognition. Therefore a timely feedback of visualized representations is beneficial to facilitate online learners to express more in-depth ideas in discourses. }

More in general, in the e-science environment, it is considered as a critical and urgent requirement to integrate services across distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic “virtual organizations” formed by different resources within a single enterprise. In the last decade, Astronomy has become an immensely data-rich field due to the evolution of detectors (plates to digital to mosaics), telescopes and space instruments. The Virtual Observatory approach consists of the federation under common standards of all astronomical archives available worldwide, as well as data analysis, data mining and data exploration applications. The main drive behind such an effort is that once the infrastructure is complete, it will allow a new type of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch science, which can only be barely imagined. Data mining, or knowledge discovery in databases, while being the main methodology to extract the scientific information contained in such Massive Data Sets (MDS), poses crucial problems since it has to orchestrate complex problems posed by transparent access to different computing environments, scalability of algorithms, reusability of resources, etc. In the present paper we summarize the present status of the \{MDS\} in the Virtual Observatory and what is currently done and planned to bring advanced data mining methodologies in the case of the \{DAME\} (DAta Mining and Exploration) project. }

Since the “standard” soft set deals with such information system, thus a transactional dataset can be represented as a soft set. Using the concept of parameters co-occurrence in a transaction, we define the notion of regular and maximal association rules between two sets of parameters, also their support, confidence and maximal support, maximal confidences, respectively properly using soft set theory. The results show that the soft regular and soft maximal association rules provide identical rules as compared to the regular and maximal association rules. }

Second, the average series cost (ASC) of the object is obtained based on the weighted sum of the distance between the two adjacent objects in \{SDS\} of the object. Finally, the density-similarity-neighbor-based outlier factor (DSNOF) of the object is calculated by using both the \{ASC\} of the object and the \{ASC\} of k-distance neighbors of the object, and the degree of the object being an outlier is indicated by the DSNOF. The experiments are performed on synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experiments results verify that the proposed algorithm has higher quality of outlier mining and do not increase the algorithm complexity. }

Actually, temporal databases are continually appended or updated so that the discovered rules need to be updated. Re-running the temporal mining algorithm every time is ineffective since it neglects the previously discovered rules, and repeats the work done previously. Furthermore, existing incremental mining techniques cannot deal with temporal association rules. In this paper, an incremental algorithm to maintain the temporal association rules in a transaction database is proposed. The algorithm benefits from the results of earlier mining to derive the final mining output. The experimental results on both the synthetic and the real dataset illustrate a significant improvement over the conventional approach of mining the entire updated database. }

  abstract = {Abstract Software fault and effort prediction are important tasks to minimize costs of a software project. In software effort prediction the aim is to forecast the effort needed to complete a software project, whereas software fault prediction tries to identify fault-prone modules. In this research both tasks are considered, thereby using different data mining techniques. The predictive models not only need to be accurate but also comprehensible, demanding that the user can understand the motivation behind the model's prediction. Unfortunately, to obtain predictive performance, comprehensibility is often sacrificed and vice versa. To overcome this problem, we extract trees from well performing Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines for regression (SVRs) making use of a rule extraction algorithm ALPA. This method builds trees (using C4.5 and REPTree) that mimic the black-box model (RF, SVR) as closely as possible. The proposed methodology is applied to publicly available datasets, complemented with new datasets that we have put together based on the Android repository. Surprisingly, the trees extracted from the black-box models by \{ALPA\} are not only comprehensible and explain how the black-box model makes (most of) its predictions, but are also more accurate than the trees obtained by working directly on the data. }

These selected English phrases serve as the last candidate term for term translation mining. Experimental results show that the supervised candidate term extraction method improves the top 10 inclusion rate by 1.6% than baseline system, which verifies that the supervised candidate term extraction method is effective. }

It helps in tracing the evolution of alleles, identification of new haplotypes and development of allele-specific markers for use in marker-assisted selection. Realizing the immense potential of allele mining, concerted allele mining efforts are underway in many international crop research institutes. This review examines the concepts, approaches and applications of allele mining along with the challenges associated while emphasizing the need for more refined ‘mining’ strategies for accelerating the process of allele discovery and its utilization in molecular breeding. }

According to the global latent semantic model learnt from the feedbacks of historical users to items, we propose an intuitive and efficient query strategy for the item selection for new active user. The time complexity in each query is reduced greatly to constant O(1). Experimental results on the public available data sets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. }

A number of related methods have been proposed based on the well-known learning models such as decision tree or neural network. Although data classification was widely discussed, relatively few studies explored the topic of temporal data classification. Most of the existing researches focused on improving the accuracy of classification by using statistical models, neural network, or distance-based methods. However, they cannot interpret the results of classification to users. In many research cases, such as gene expression of microarray, users prefer the classification information above a classifier only with a high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-based data mining method, namely classify-by-sequence (CBS), for classifying large temporal datasets. The main methodology behind the \{CBS\} is integrating sequential pattern mining with probabilistic induction. The \{CBS\} has the merit of simplicity in implementation and its pattern-based architecture can supply clear classification information to users. Through experimental evaluation, the \{CBS\} was shown to deliver classification results with high accuracy under two real time series datasets. In addition, we designed a simulator to evaluate the performance of \{CBS\} under datasets with different characteristics. The experimental results show that \{CBS\} can discover the hidden patterns and classify data effectively by utilizing the mined sequential patterns. }

The purpose of this study is to develop a data mining(DM) solution which makes diagnosis of tuberculosis as accurate as possible and helps deciding if it is reasonable to start tuberculosis treatment on suspected patients without waiting the exact medical test results or not. In this research, we proposed the use of Sugeno-type “adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system” (ANFIS) to predict the existence of mycobacterium tuberculosis. 667 different patient records which are obtained from a clinic are used in the entire process of this research. Each of the patient records consist of 30 separate input parameters. \{ANFIS\} model is generated by using 500 of those records. We also implemented a multilayer perceptron and \{PART\} model using the same data set. The \{ANFIS\} model classifies the instances with an \{RMSE\} of 18% whereas Multilayer Perceptron does the same classification with an \{RMSE\} of % 19 and \{PART\} algorithm with an \{RMSE\} of % 20. \{ANFIS\} is an accurate and reliable method when compared with Multilayer Perceptron and \{PART\} algorithms for classification of tuberculosis patients. This study has contribution on forecasting patients before the medical tests. }

In this paper, however, we are interested in keeping attributes that best discriminate between products. For that we present a data mining-based method for attribute selection in descriptive sensory panels, such as those used in the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. The proposed method is implemented using Principal Component Analysis and the k-Nearest Neighbor classification technique, in conjunction with Pareto Optimal analysis. Objectives are (i) to identity the set of attributes that best discriminate samples analyzed in the panel, and (ii) to indicate the group of panelists that provide consistent evaluations. The method is illustrated through a case study where beef cubes in stew, used as combat ration by the American Army, are characterized in sensory panels using the Spectrum protocol. }

Text data mining (or text mining) has become one of the most active research sub-fields in data mining. Significant developments in the area of biomedical text mining during the past years have demonstrated its great promise for supporting scientists in developing novel hypotheses and new knowledge from the biomedical literature. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) provides a distinct methodology with which to view human life. It is one of the most complete and distinguished traditional medicines with a history of several thousand years of studying and practicing the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. It has been shown that the \{TCM\} knowledge obtained from clinical practice has become a significant complementary source of information for modern biomedical sciences. \{TCM\} literature obtained from the historical period and from modern clinical studies has recently been transformed into digital data in the form of relational databases or text documents, which provide an effective platform for information sharing and retrieval. This motivates and facilitates research and development into knowledge discovery approaches and to modernize TCM. In order to contribute to this still growing field, this paper presents (1) a comparative introduction to \{TCM\} and modern biomedicine, (2) a survey of the related information sources of TCM, (3) a review and discussion of the state of the art and the development of text mining techniques with applications to TCM, (4) a discussion of the research issues around \{TCM\} text mining and its future directions. }

This technique can provide more useful knowledge in comparison with conventional data mining techniques. }

Our research work is to propose a method, which collect tweets using a specific keyword and then, summarizes them to find out topics related to that keyword. The topic detection is done by using clusters of frequent patterns. Already existing pattern oriented topic detection techniques suffer from the wrong correlation problem of patterns. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, \{TDA\} (Topic Detection using AGF) and \{TCTR\} (Topic Clustering and Tweet Retrieval), which will help to overcome this problem. From various experimental results, it is observed that the proposed method can maintain good performance irrespective of the size of the data set. }

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of text documents, document clustering has become one of the main techniques for organizing large amount of documents into a small number of meaningful clusters. However, there still exist several challenges for document clustering, such as high dimensionality, scalability, accuracy, meaningful cluster labels, overlapping clusters, and extracting semantics from texts. In order to improve the quality of document clustering results, we propose an effective Fuzzy-based Multi-label Document Clustering (FMDC) approach that integrates fuzzy association rule mining with an existing ontology WordNet to alleviate these problems. In our approach, the key terms will be extracted from the document set, and the initial representation of all documents is further enriched by using hypernyms of WordNet in order to exploit the semantic relations between terms. Then, a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for texts is employed to discover a set of highly-related fuzzy frequent itemsets, which contain key terms to be regarded as the labels of the candidate clusters. Finally, each document is dispatched into more than one target cluster by referring to these candidate clusters, and then the highly similar target clusters are merged. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance based on Classic, Re0, R8, and WebKB datasets. The experimental results proved that our approach outperforms the influential document clustering methods with higher accuracy. Therefore, our approach not only provides more general and meaningful labels for documents, but also effectively generates overlapping clusters. }

A hybrid artificial immune network (Opt-aiNet) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) (aiNet-PSO) is then proposed to allocate the order quantity for the key suppliers at minimum cost. In order to verify the proposed method, a case company’s daily purchasing ledger is used, with emphasis on the consumer electronic product manufacturers. The computational results indicate that the TD-FP-growth algorithm can select the key suppliers using the historical data. The proposed hybrid method also provides a cheaper solution than a genetic algorithm, particle swam optimization, or an artificial immune system. }

  abstract = {As the Internet has been the virtual place where citizens are united and their opinions are promptly shifted into the action, two way communications between the government sector and the citizen have been more important among activities of e-Government. Hence, Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) in the Republic of Korea has constructed the online petition portal system named e-People. In addition, the nation’s Open Innovation through e-People has gained increasing attention. That is because e-People can be applied for the virtual space where citizens participate in improving the national law and policy by simply filing petitions to e-People as the voice of the nation. However, currently there are problems and challenging issues to be solved until e-People can function as the virtual space for the nation’s Open Innovation based on petitions collected from citizens. First, there is no objective and systematic method for analyzing a large number of petitions filed to e-People without a lot of manual works of petition inspectors. Second, e-People is required to forecast the trend of petitions filed to e-People more accurately and quickly than petition inspectors for making a better decision on the national law and policy strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the framework of applying text and data mining techniques not only to analyze a large number of petitions filed to e-People but also to predict the trend of petitions. In detail, we apply text mining techniques to unstructured data of petitions to elicit keywords from petitions and identify groups of petitions with the elicited keywords. Moreover, we apply data mining techniques to structured data of the identified petition groups on purpose to forecast the trend of petitions. Our approach based on applying text and data mining techniques decreases time-consuming manual works on reading and classifying a large number of petitions, and contributes to increasing accuracy in evaluating the trend of petitions. Eventually, it helps petition inspectors to give more attention on detecting and tracking important groups of petitions that possibly grow as nationwide problems. Further, the petitions ordered by their petition groups’ trend values can be used as the baseline for making a better decision on the national law and policy strategy. }

IoT ecosystems generate a vast amount of data that needs to be stored and processed, becoming a Big Data problem. In this paper we present a platform that is specifically designed for mining the information associated to the IoT, including both sensors data and meta-data. The platform is composed of two major components: servIoTicy for storing and processing data, and iServe for the publication and discovery of sensors meta-data. The former provides capabilities to ingest, transform on real time and query data generated by sensors; the latter provides capabilities to publish, discover and use sensors based on semantic information associated to them. Both components are clearly designed for scalability, as any IoT cloud deployment requires. Both servIoTicy and iServe are available as an open source projects. }

Several top 10 data mining methods have become very popular alternatives in business failure prediction (BFP), e.g., support vector machine and k nearest neighbor. In comparison with the other classification mining methods, advantages of classification and regression tree (CART) methods include: simplicity of results, easy implementation, nonlinear estimation, being non-parametric, accuracy and stable. However, there are seldom researches in the area of \{BFP\} that witness the applicability of CART, another method among the top 10 algorithms in data mining. The aim of this research is to explore the performance of \{BFP\} using the commonly discussed data mining technique of CART. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \{BFP\} using CART, business failure predicting tasks were performed on the data set collected from companies listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Thirty times’ hold-out method was employed as the assessment, and the two commonly used methods in the top 10 data mining algorithms, i.e., support vector machine and k nearest neighbor, and the two baseline benchmark methods from statistic area, i.e., multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logistics regression, were employed as comparative methods. For comparative methods, stepwise method of \{MDA\} was employed to select optimal feature subset. Empirical results indicated that the optimal algorithm of \{CART\} outperforms all the comparative methods in terms of predictive performance and significance test in short-term \{BFP\} of Chinese listed companies. }

  abstract = {In privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), a widely used method for achieving data mining goals while preserving privacy is based on k-anonymity. This method, which protects subject-specific sensitive data by anonymizing it before it is released for data mining, demands that every tuple in the released table should be indistinguishable from no fewer than k subjects. The most common approach for achieving compliance with k-anonymity is to replace certain values with less specific but semantically consistent values. In this paper we propose a different approach for achieving k-anonymity by partitioning the original dataset into several projections such that each one of them adheres to k-anonymity. Moreover, any attempt to rejoin the projections, results in a table that still complies with k-anonymity. A classifier is trained on each projection and subsequently, an unlabelled instance is classified by combining the classifications of all classifiers. Guided by classification accuracy and k-anonymity constraints, the proposed data mining privacy by decomposition (DMPD) algorithm uses a genetic algorithm to search for optimal feature set partitioning. Ten separate datasets were evaluated with \{DMPD\} in order to compare its classification performance with other k-anonymity-based methods. The results suggest that \{DMPD\} performs better than existing k-anonymity-based algorithms and there is no necessity for applying domain dependent knowledge. Using multiobjective optimization methods, we also examine the tradeoff between the two conflicting objectives in PPDM: privacy and predictive performance. }

Improved technologies could mean faster and easier access to information but do not necessarily ensure the quality of this information; for this reason it is essential to develop valid and reliable methods of quality measurement and carry out careful information quality evaluations. This paper proposes an assessment model for information quality in e-learning systems based on the quality framework we proposed previously: the proposed framework consists of 14 quality dimensions grouped in three quality factors: intrinsic, contextual representation and accessibility. We use the relative importance as a parameter in a linear equation for the measurement scheme. Formerly, we implemented a goal-question-metrics approach to develop a set of quality metrics for the identified quality attributes within the proposed framework. In this paper, the proposed metrics were computed to produce a numerical rating indicating the overall information quality published in a particular e-learning system. The data collection and evaluation processes were automated using a web data extraction technique and results on a case study are discussed. This assessment model could be useful to e-learning systems designers, providers and users as it provides a comprehensive indication of the quality of information in such systems. }

It presents a Joint Topic Viewpoint (JTV) probabilistic model to analyze the underlying divergent arguing expressions that may be present in a collection of contentious documents. The conceived \{JTV\} has the potential of automatically carrying the tasks of extracting associated terms denoting an arguing expression, according to the hidden topics it discusses and the embedded viewpoint it voices. Furthermore, JTV's structure enables the unsupervised grouping of obtained arguing expressions according to their viewpoints, using a proposed constrained clustering algorithm which is an adapted version of the constrained k-means clustering (COP-KMEANS). Experiments are conducted on three types of contentious documents (polls, online debates and editorials), through six different contentious data sets. Quantitative evaluations of the topic modeling output, as well as the constrained clustering results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to fit the data and generate distinctive patterns of arguing expressions. Moreover, it empirically demonstrates a better clustering of arguing expressions over state-of-the art and baseline methods. The qualitative analysis highlights the coherence of clustered arguing expressions of the same viewpoint and the divergence of opposing ones. }

This paper canvasses perspectives on applying data mining techniques to journal entries. In the past, the impediment to researching journal entry data mining is getting access to journal entry data sets, which may explain why the published research in this area is a null set. For this project, we had access to journal entry data sets for 29 different organizations. Our initial exploratory test of the data sets had interesting preliminary findings. (1) For all 29 entities, the distribution of first digits of journal dollar amounts differed from that expected by Benford's Law. (2) Regarding last digits, unlike first digits, which are expected to have a logarithmic distribution, the last digits would be expected to have a uniform distribution. Our test found that the distribution was not uniform for many of the entities. In fact, eight entities had one number whose frequency was three times more than expected. (3) We compared the number of accounts related to the top five most frequently occurring three last digit combinations. Four entities had a very high occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved only a small set of accounts, one entity had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combination that involved a large set of accounts and 24 had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved a small set of accounts. In general, the first four entities would probably pose the highest risk of fraud because it could indicate that the fraudster is covering up or falsifying a particular class of transactions. In the future, we will apply more data mining techniques to discover other patterns and relationships in the data sets. We also want to seed the dataset with fraud indicators (e.g., pairs of accounts that would not be expected in a journal entry) and compare the sensitivity of the different data mining techniques to find these seeded indicators. }

In the past, many algorithms were proposed for mining association rules, most of which were based on items with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. In this paper, the frequent fuzzy pattern tree (fuzzy FP-tree) is proposed for extracting frequent fuzzy itemsets from the transactions with quantitative values. When extending the FP-tree to handle fuzzy data, the processing becomes much more complex than the original since fuzzy intersection in each transaction has to be handled. The fuzzy FP-tree construction algorithm is thus designed, and the mining process based on the tree is presented. Experimental results on three different numbers of fuzzy regions also show the performance of the proposed approach. }

  abstract = {Abstract It is well-known that synonymous and polysemous terms often bring in some noise when we calculate the similarity between documents. Existing ontology-based document representation methods are static so that the selected semantic concepts for representing a document have a fixed resolution. Therefore, they are not adaptable to the characteristics of document collection and the text mining problem in hand. We propose an Adaptive Concept Resolution (ACR) model to overcome this problem. \{ACR\} can learn a concept border from an ontology taking into the consideration of the characteristics of the particular document collection. Then, this border provides a tailor-made semantic concept representation for a document coming from the same domain. Another advantage of \{ACR\} is that it is applicable in both classification task where the groups are given in the training document set and clustering task where no group information is available. The experimental results show that \{ACR\} outperforms an existing static method in almost all cases. We also present a method to integrate Wikipedia entities into an expert-edited ontology, namely WordNet, to generate an enhanced ontology named WordNet-Plus, and its performance is also examined under the \{ACR\} model. Due to the high coverage, WordNet-Plus can outperform WordNet on data sets having more fresh documents in classification. }

  abstract = {Abstract Basic categories of information structure (e.g. topic, focus, contrast) are known to be crosslinguistically expressed by various linguistic devices such as special intonation contours, syntactic mechanisms, and morphological markers. However, the nature of the relation between the categories and their linguistic “markers” has been rarely discussed. To be more specific, despite the rich literature on information structure, whether the categories are directly or indirectly related to their markers has not been of much interest to linguists until quite recently. The main purpose of this paper is to unveil the nature of the relation between Korean -(n)un and the information-structural notions related to it, namely, topic and contrast. Based on a corpus study, it will be claimed that -(n)un is not a topic/contrast marker per se but its function is to impose salience on a discourse referent. Topicality and contrast, widely assumed to be directly marked by -(n)un, will be claimed to be only derived from the interaction of the proposed meaning of -(n)un and various syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors. Consequently, this paper provides a strong support for recent attempts to show that the information-structural categories are merely pragmatic effects rather than stable and discrete universal primitives. }

Reducing fraud risk involves both detection and prevention. Accordingly, a descriptive data mining strategy is applied as opposed to the widely used prediction data mining techniques in the literature. The results of using a multivariate latent class clustering algorithm to a case company's procurement data suggest that applying this technique in a descriptive data mining approach is useful in assessing the current risk of internal fraud. The same results could not be obtained by applying a univariate analysis. }

Second, this algorithm is combined with K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) to develop unsupervised text mining approach. We use the proposed text mining approach to group the forums into various clusters, with the center of each representing a hotspot forum within the current time span. The data sets used in our empirical studies are acquired and formatted from Sina sports forums, which spans a range of 31 different topic forums and 220,053 posts. Experimental results demonstrate that \{SVM\} forecasting achieves highly consistent results with K-means clustering. The top 10 hotspot forums listed by \{SVM\} forecasting resembles 80% of K-means clustering results. Both \{SVM\} and K-means achieve the same results for the top 4 hotspot forums of the year. }

It is very desirable to remove the operator from the vicinity of the landmine and from the repetitive, boring operations that lead to loss of attention and potential injury. Tele-operated platforms naturally support multiple sensors and data fusion, which are necessary for reliable detection. Tele-operation of handheld sensors or multisensor-heads can enhance the detection process by allowing more precise scanning, which is useful for optimization of the signal processing algorithms. This chapter summarizes the technologies and experiences presented during seven \{IARP\} workshops \{HUDEM\} and three \{IARP\} workshops RISE, based on general considerations and illustrated by some contributions of our own laboratory, located at the Royal Military Academy of Brussels, focusing on the detection of unexploded devices and the implementation of mobile robotics systems on minefields. }

In this paper, we aim to show that graph-based data mining tools are useful to deal with scientogram analysis. Subdue, the first algorithm proposed in the graph mining area, has been chosen for this purpose. This algorithm has been customized to deal with three different scientogram analysis tasks regarding the evolution of a scientific domain over time, the extraction of the common research categories substructures in the world, and the comparison of scientific domains between different countries. The outcomes obtained in the developed experiments have clearly demonstrated the potential of graph mining tools in scientogram analysis. }

While domain-specific and general-purpose ontologies have been developed, few attempts have been made for a situation ontology that can be employed directly to support activity-oriented context-aware services. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically constructing a large-scale situation ontology by mining large-scale web resources, eHow and wikiHow, which contain an enormous amount of how-to instructions (e.g., “How to install a car amplifier”). The construction process is guided by a situation model derived from the procedural knowledge available in the web resources. Two major steps involved are: (1) action mining that extracts pairs of a verb and its ingredient (i.e., objects, location, and time) from individual instructional steps (e.g., &lt;disconnect, ground cable&gt;) and forms goal-oriented situation cases using the results and (2) normalization and integration of situation cases to form the situation ontology. For validation, we measure accuracy of the action mining method and show how our situation ontology compares in terms of coverage with existing large-scale ontology-like resources constructed manually. Furthermore, we show how it can be utilized for two applications: service recommendation and service composition. }

Moreover, the existing method also has the drawback that it will build unnecessary relationships or lose some relationships between concepts in the constructed concept maps.

Recent trends demonstrate the urgent need to manage the large amounts of data stream, especially in specific domains of application such as critical infrastructure systems, sensor networks, log file analysis, search engines and more recently, social networks. All of these applications involve large-scale data-intensive tasks, often subject to time constraints and space complexity. Algorithms, data management and data retrieval techniques must be able to process data stream, i.e., process data as it becomes available and provide an accurate response, based solely on the data stream that has already been provided. Data retrieval techniques often require traditional data storage and processing approach, i.e., all data must be available in the storage space in order to be processed. For instance, a widely used relevance measure is Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF), which can evaluate how important a word is in a collection of documents and requires to a priori know the whole dataset. To address this problem, we propose an approximate version of the TF–IDF measure suitable to work on continuous data stream (such as the exchange of messages, tweets and sensor-based log files). The algorithm for the calculation of this measure makes two assumptions: a fast response is required, and memory is both limited and infinitely smaller than the size of the data stream. In addition, to face the great computational power required to process massive data stream, we present also a parallel implementation of the approximate TF–IDF calculation using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This implementation of the algorithm was tested on generated and real data stream and was able to capture the most frequent terms. Our results demonstrate that the approximate version of the TF–IDF measure performs at a level that is comparable to the solution of the precise TF–IDF measure. }

Existing novelty metrics can be divided into two types, symmetric and asymmetric, based on whether the ordering of sentences is taken into account. After a comparative study of several different novelty metrics, we observe complementary behavior in the two types of metrics. This finding motivates a new framework of novelty measurement, i.e. the mixture of both symmetric and asymmetric metrics. This new framework of novelty measurement performs superiorly under different performance requirements varying from high-precision to high-recall as well as for data with different percentages of novel sentences. Because it does not require any prior information, the new metric is very suitable for real-time knowledge base applications such as novelty mining systems where no training data is available beforehand. }

We mined an Automobile Insurance Fraud detection dataset and customer Credit Card Churn prediction dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Throughout the paper, we followed 10 fold cross validation method of testing using Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). We observed that \{DT\} and \{SVM\} respectively yielded high sensitivity of 90.74% and 91.89% on Insurance dataset and DT, \{SVM\} and \{GMDH\} respectively produced high sensitivity of 91.2%, 87.7%, and 83.1% on Credit Card Churn Prediction dataset. In the case of Insurance Fraud detection dataset, we found that statistically there is no significant difference between \{DT\} (J48) and SVM. As \{DT\} yields “if then” rules, we prefer \{DT\} over SVM. Further, in the case of churn prediction dataset, it turned out that GMDH, \{SVM\} and \{LR\} are not statistically different and \{GMDH\} yielded very high Area Under Curve at ROC. Further, \{DT\} yielded just 4 ‘if–then’ rules on Insurance and 10 rules on churn prediction datasets, which is the significant outcome of the study. }

  abstract = {Electronic commerce (EC) has become a trend in the world nowadays. However, most researches neglect a fundamental issue – the user’s product-specific knowledge on which the useful intelligent systems are based. This research employs the user’s product-specific knowledge and mine his/her interior desire on appropriate target products as a part of personalization process to construct the overall \{EC\} strategy for businesses. This paper illustrates a novel web usage mining approach, based on the sequence mining technique applied to user’s navigation behaviour, to discover patterns in the navigation of websites. Three critical contributions are made in this paper: (1) using the footstep graph to visualize the user’s click-stream data and any interesting pattern can be detected more easily and quickly; (2) illustrating a novel sequence mining approach to identify pre-designated user navigation patterns automatically and integrates back-propagation network (BPN) model smoothly; and (3) applying the empirical research to indicate that the proposed approach can predict and categorize the users’ navigation behaviour with high accuracy. }

  abstract = {AbstractObjectives Extracting useful visual clues from medical images allowing accurate diagnoses requires physicians’ domain knowledge acquired through years of systematic study and clinical training. This is especially true in the dermatology domain, a medical specialty that requires physicians to have image inspection experience. Automating or at least aiding such efforts requires understanding physicians’ reasoning processes and their use of domain knowledge. Mining physicians’ references to medical concepts in narratives during image-based diagnosis of a disease is an interesting research topic that can help reveal experts’ reasoning processes. It can also be a useful resource to assist with design of information technologies for image use and for image case-based medical education systems. Methods and materials We collected data for analyzing physicians’ diagnostic reasoning processes by conducting an experiment that recorded their spoken descriptions during inspection of dermatology images. In this paper we focus on the benefit of physicians’ spoken descriptions and provide a general workflow for mining medical domain knowledge based on linguistic data from these narratives. The challenge of a medical image case can influence the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as how physicians pursue the diagnostic process. Accordingly, we define two lexical metrics for physicians’ narratives—lexical consensus score and top N relatedness score—and evaluate their usefulness by assessing the diagnostic challenge levels of corresponding medical images. We also report on clustering medical images based on anchor concepts obtained from physicians’ medical term usage. These analyses are based on physicians’ spoken narratives that have been preprocessed by incorporating the Unified Medical Language System for detecting medical concepts. Results The image rankings based on lexical consensus score and on top 1 relatedness score are well correlated with those based on challenge levels (Spearman correlation &gt;0.5 and Kendall correlation &gt;0.4). Clustering results are largely improved based on our anchor concept method (accuracy &gt;70% and mutual information &gt;80%). Conclusions Physicians’ spoken narratives are valuable for the purpose of mining the domain knowledge that physicians use in medical image inspections. We also show that the semantic metrics introduced in the paper can be successfully applied to medical image understanding and allow discussion of additional uses of these metrics. }

Therefore, models for predicting the potential habitat of oaks can be a valuable tool for work in the environment. In accordance with this objective, the building and comparison of data mining models are presented for the prediction of potential habitats for the oak forest type in Mediterranean areas (southern Spain), with conclusions applicable to other regions. Thirty-one environmental input variables were measured and six base models for supervised classification problems were selected: linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, classification trees, neural networks and support vector machines. Three ensemble methods, based on the combination of classification tree models fitted from samples and sets of variables generated from the original data set were also evaluated: bagging, random forests and boosting. The available data set was randomly split into three parts: training set (50%), validation set (25%), and test set (25%). The analysis of the accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity, together with the area under the \{ROC\} curve for the test set reveal that the best models for our oak data set are those of bagging and random forests. All of these models can be fitted by free R programs which use the libraries and functions described in this paper. Furthermore, the methodology used in this study will allow researchers to determine the potential distribution of oaks in other kinds of areas. }

One of the most important challenges for data mining is quickly and correctly finding the relationship among data. The Apriori algorithm has been the most popular technique in finding frequent patterns. However, when applying this method, a database has to be scanned many times to calculate the counts of a huge number of candidate itemsets. Parallel and distributed computing is an effective strategy for accelerating the mining process. In this paper, the Distributed Parallel Apriori (DPA) algorithm is proposed as a solution to this problem. In the proposed method, metadata are stored in the form of Transaction Identifiers (TIDs), such that only a single scan to the database is needed. The approach also takes the factor of itemset counts into consideration, thus generating a balanced workload among processors and reducing processor idle time. Experiments on a \{PC\} cluster with 16 computing nodes are also made to show the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with some other parallel mining algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the others, especially while the minimum supports are low. }

These techniques are traditionally built from systems modeling approaches including simulation, blind decovolution, and state estimation. In this work, we define target time series (TTS) and its related time series (RTS) as the output and input of a time series estimation process, respectively. We then propose a novel data mining framework for time series estimation when \{TTS\} and \{RTS\} represent different sets of observed variables from the same dynamic system. This is made possible by mining a database of instances of TTS, its simultaneously recorded RTS, and the input/output dynamic models between them. The key mining strategy is to formulate a mapping function for each TTS–RTS pair in the database that translates a feature vector extracted from \{RTS\} to the dissimilarity between true \{TTS\} and its estimate from the dynamic model associated with the same TTS–RTS pair. At run time, a feature vector is extracted from an inquiry \{RTS\} and supplied to the mapping function associated with each TTS–RTS pair to calculate a dissimilarity measure. An optimal TTS–RTS pair is then selected by analyzing these dissimilarity measures. The associated input/output model of the selected TTS–RTS pair is then used to simulate the \{TTS\} given the inquiry \{RTS\} as an input. An exemplary implementation was built to address a biomedical problem of noninvasive intracranial pressure assessment. The performance of the proposed method was superior to that of a simple training-free approach of finding the optimal TTS–RTS pair by a conventional similarity-based search on \{RTS\} features. }

In this paper, we will present an effective Fuzzy Frequent Itemset-Based Hierarchical Clustering (F2IHC) approach, which uses fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to improve the clustering accuracy of Frequent Itemset-Based Hierarchical Clustering (FIHC) method. In our approach, the key terms will be extracted from the document set, and each document is pre-processed into the designated representation for the following mining process. Then, a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for text is employed to discover a set of highly-related fuzzy frequent itemsets, which contain key terms to be regarded as the labels of the candidate clusters. Finally, these documents will be clustered into a hierarchical cluster tree by referring to these candidate clusters. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the performance based on Classic4, Hitech, Re0, Reuters, and Wap datasets. The experimental results show that our approach not only absolutely retains the merits of FIHC, but also improves the accuracy quality of FIHC. }

The models are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models and can detect patterns in sensor data in an unsupervised manner. LDA–Gaussian, the first variation of the model, is a combination of a Gaussian Mixture Model and the \{LDA\} model. Here the multinomial distribution that is normally used in the \{LDA\} model is replaced by a set of Gaussian distributions. LDA–Poisson, the second variation of the model, uses a set of Poisson distribution to model the observations. The Poisson distribution is better suited to handle counts of stochastic events but less well-suited to model time. For this we use the von Mises distribution, resulting in ‘LDA–Poisson–von-Mises’. The parameters of the models are determined with an EM-algorithm. The models are evaluated on more than 450 days of real-world sensor data, gathered in the homes of five elderly people, and are compared with a baseline approach where standard k-means clustering is used to quantize the data. We show that the new models find more meaningful topics than the baseline and that a semantic description of these topics can be given. We also evaluated the models quantitatively, using perplexity as measure for the model fit. Both LDA–Gaussian and LDA–Poisson result in much better models than the baseline, and our experiments show that, of the proposed models, the LDA–Poisson–von-Mises model performs best. }

Although a person can conveniently find and download specific learning materials to gain fragmented knowledge, most of the materials are imperfect and have no particular order in the content. Therefore, most of the self-directed learners spend most of time in surveying and choosing the right learning materials collected from the Internet. This paper develops a web-based learning support system that harnesses two approaches, the learning path constructing approach and the learning object recommending approach. With collected documents and a learning subject from a learner, the system first discovers some candidate courses by using a data mining approach based on the Apriori algorithm. Next, the leaning path constructing approach, based on the Formal Concept Analysis, builds a Concept Lattice, using keywords extracted from some selected documents, to form a relationship hierarchy of all the concepts represented by the keywords. It then uses \{FCA\} to further compute mutual relationships among documents to decide a suitable learning path. For a chosen learning path, the support system uses both the preference-based and the correlation-based algorithms for recommending the most suitable learning objects or documents for each unit of the courses in order to facilitate more efficient learning for the learner. This e-learning support system can be embedded in any information retrieval system for surfers to do more efficient learning on the Internet. }

We use an activity composite/primitive abstraction and analyze three public datasets with different properties that affect the discovery, including primitive rate, activity composite specificity, primitive sequence similarity, and composite-instance ratio. We compare the activity composite discovery performance among the \{TM\} approaches and against a baseline using k -means clustering. We provide guidelines for method and optimal \{TM\} parameter selection, depending on data properties and activity primitive noise. Results indicate that \{TMs\} can outperform k -means clustering up to 17%, when composite specificity is low. LDA-based \{TMs\} showed higher robustness against noise compared to other \{TMs\} and k -means. }

The system is context-specific, modular, and scalable and able to capture direct and indirect associations among 2,545 biomedical concepts. An easy-to-use Web interface was developed to query, interact, and visualize the results. Empirical studies showed that the system was able to find novel associations and generate new hypotheses. For instance, the system captured the association between the drug hexamethonium and pulmonary fibrosis, which in 2001 caused the tragic death of a healthy volunteer.

  abstract = {Knowledge is a critical resource that organizations use to gain and maintain competitive advantages. In the constantly changing business environment, organizations must exploit effective and efficient methods of preserving, sharing and reusing knowledge in order to help knowledge workers find task-relevant information. Hence, an important issue is how to discover and model the knowledge flow (KF) of workers from their historical work records. The objectives of a knowledge flow model are to understand knowledge workers’ task-needs and the ways they reference documents, and then provide adaptive knowledge support. This work proposes hybrid recommendation methods based on the knowledge flow model, which integrates \{KF\} mining, sequential rule mining and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend codified knowledge. These KF-based recommendation methods involve two phases: a \{KF\} mining phase and a KF-based recommendation phase. The \{KF\} mining phase identifies each worker’s knowledge flow by analyzing his/her knowledge referencing behavior (information needs), while the KF-based recommendation phase utilizes the proposed hybrid methods to proactively provide relevant codified knowledge for the worker. Therefore, the proposed methods use workers’ preferences for codified knowledge as well as their knowledge referencing behavior to predict their topics of interest and recommend task-related knowledge. Using data collected from a research institute laboratory, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid methods and compare them with the traditional \{CF\} method. The results of experiments demonstrate that utilizing the document preferences and knowledge referencing behavior of workers can effectively improve the quality of recommendations and facilitate efficient knowledge sharing. }

Firstly, an entity template library is built to retrieve pharmacokinetics relevant articles. Then a set of tagging and extraction rules are applied to retrieve \{PK\} data from the article abstracts.

Finally, a cross-validation procedure is developed to ascertain false-positive mining results. Using this approach to mine midazolam (MDZ) \{PK\} data, an 88% precision rate and 92% recall rate are achieved, with an F-score&#xa0;=&#xa0;90%. It greatly out-performs a conventional data mining approach (support vector machine), which has an F-score of 68.1%.

  abstract = {Abstract It is a great challenge to process big data in bioinformatics. In this paper, we addressed the problem of identifying protein–protein interfacial residues from massive protein structural data. A protein set, comprising 154 993 residues, was analyzed. We applied the three-dimensional alpha shape modeling to the search of surface and interfacial residues in this set, and adopted the spatially neighboring residue profiles to characterize each residue. These residue profiles, which revealed the sequential and spatial information of proteins, translated the original data into a large matrix. After vertically and horizontally refining this matrix, we comparably implemented a series of popular learning procedures, including neuro-fuzzy classifiers (NFCs), CART, neighborhood classifiers (NECs), extreme learning machines (ELMs) and naive Bayesian classifiers (NBCs), to predict the interfacial residues, aiming to investigate the sensitivity of these massive structural data to different learning mechanisms. As a consequence, ELMs, \{CART\} and \{NFCs\} performed better in terms of computational costs; NFCs, \{NBCs\} and \{ELMs\} provided favorable prediction accuracies. Overall, NFCs, \{NBCs\} and \{ELMs\} are favourable choices for fastly and accurately handling this type of data. More importantly, the marginal differences between the prediction performances of these methods imply the insensitivity of this type of data to different learning mechanisms. }

This review will discuss how new \{PTP\} functions have been uncovered through studies that have utilized genomic and proteomic technologies and strategies. }

Preferred Terms (PT) vs. High Level Terms (HLT) vs. Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ). Methods For a representative set of 26 drugs, data from the \{FDA\} Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database from 2001 through 2005 was mined for signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) using three different data mining algorithms (DMAs): the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), the urn-model algorithm (URN), and the proportional reporting rate (PRR) algorithm. Results were evaluated using a previously described Reference Event Database (RED) which contains documented drug–event associations for the 26 drugs. Analysis emphasized the percentage of \{SDRs\} in the “unlabeled supported” category, corresponding to those adverse events that were not described in the U.S. prescribing information for the drug at the time of its approval, but which were supported by some published evidence for an association with the drug. Results Based on a logistic regression analysis, the percentage of unlabeled supported \{SDRs\} was smallest at the \{PT\} level, intermediate at the \{HLT\} level, and largest at the \{SMQ\} level, for all three algorithms. The \{GPS\} and \{URN\} methods detected comparable percentages of unlabeled supported \{SDRs\} while the \{PRR\} method detected a smaller percentage, at all three MedDRA levels. No evidence of a method/level interaction was seen. Conclusions Use of \{HLT\} and \{SMQ\} groupings can improve the percentage of unlabeled supported \{SDRs\} in data mining results. The trade-off for this gain is the medically less-specific language of \{HLTs\} and \{SMQs\} compared to PTs, and the need for the added step in data mining of examining the component \{PTs\} of each \{HLT\} or \{SMQ\} that results in a signal of disproportionate reporting. }

To seek for sustainable development, the mining city has to make a key decision in the process of industry transition. Firstly, based on the perspective of evolutionary game, the paper has analyzed the state transcending equation which refers to the problem of whether the mining city needs to restructure its industry or not and its corresponding behaviour gaming under the different states of space set. So, the decision-making threshold on its industry transition has also been estimated from the former analysis. Secondly, two different industry transition types of mining cities are analyzed from the dynamic perspective through which the each equilibrium of those games’ evolutionary strategies have also been deduced. One type is a substituting structure system in which the city withdraws entirely from the current resource-based industry and constitutes a whole new industry structure. The other type is upgrading the mining city’s industrial structure through implementing technological transformation and industrial innovation. Lastly, the paper suggests some focused measures for the mining city on its future pattern of sustainable development on the basis of previous analyses. }

Methods \{DGE\} analysis based on the Solexa Genome Analyzer platform was performed on vascular endothelial cells incubated with serum of hypertension patients with BSS. The differentially expressed genes were filtered by comparing the expression levels between the different experimental groups. Then functional categories and enriched pathways of the unique genes for \{BSS\} were analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to select those in the enrichment pathways. Interologous Interaction Database (I2D) was used to construct \{PPI\} networks with the selected genes for hypertension patients with BSS. The potential candidate genes related to \{BSS\} were identified by comparing the number of relationships among genes. Confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), gene ontology (GO) analysis was used to infer the functional annotations of the potential candidate genes for BSS. Results With gene enrichment analysis using DAVID, a list of 58 genes was chosen from the unique genes. The selected 58 genes were analyzed using I2D, and a \{PPI\} network was constructed. Based on the network analysis results, candidate genes for \{BSS\} were identified: DDIT3, JUN, HSPA8, NFIL3, HSPA5, HIST2H2BE, H3F3B, CEBPB, \{SAT1\} and GADD45A. Verified through qRT-PCR and analyzed by GO, the functional annotations of the potential candidate genes were explored. Conclusion Compared with previous methodologies reported in the literature, the present \{DGE\} analysis and data mining method have shown a great improvement in analyzing BSS. }

We reproduce Swanson’s discovery of a connection between magnesium and migraine in a novel approach that uses only proteins as the intermediate B terms. We validate our methods by using a cutoff date and evaluate them by calculating precision and recall. In addition to magnesium, we have identified valproic acid and nitric oxide as chemicals which developed links to migraine.

The fuzzy and the object concepts have also been very popular and used in a variety of applications, especially for complex data description. This paper thus proposes a new fuzzy object-oriented web mining algorithm to derive fuzzy knowledge from object data log on web servers. Each web page itself is thought of as a class, and each web page browsed by a client is thought of as an instance. Instances with the same class (web page) may have different quantitative attribute values since they may appear in different clients. The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm can be divided into two main phases. The first phase is called the fuzzy intra-page mining phase, in which the linguistic large itemsets associated with the same classes (pages) but with different attributes are derived. Each linguistic large itemset found in this phase is then thought of as a composite item used in phase 2. The second phase is called the fuzzy inter-page mining phase, in which the large sequences are derived and used to represent the relationship among different web pages. Both the intra-page linguistic association rules and inter-page linguistic browsing patterns can thus be easily derived by the proposed algorithm at the same time. An example is given to illustrate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results also show the effects of the parameters used in the algorithm. }

The Gállego drains about 4000&#xa0;km2 of the southern slopes of the Pyrenees. Good channel surveys since the 1940s allowed a comparison of longitudinal bed profiles over time. Over this period about 1&#xa0;million m3 of gravel was mined according to the archival records. The volume of alluvium lost due to incision in the same period was 2&#xa0;million m3. This imbalance is tentatively explained by a budget model based on a bedload equation and an algorithm to determine whether the effective bedload transport is controlled by the transport capacity or by the supply of sediment. It appears that the incision process has changed the magnitude of the shear stresses on channel bed. As the river became deeper, the channel could accommodate higher discharges without overbank flooding. The results obtained from a second model based on diffusion equation for the bed elevation compared well with the field data. This model is based on the hypotheses of steady uniform flow regarding water and sediment conservation. }

  abstract = {Evidence-based dentistry has shown that different restorative materials have different survival times. Our primary hypothesis is that this should be revealed from normal dental records by the use of data mining technique and a practice-based dentistry approach analysed in a scientifically sound way. Dental records from 1626 patients and altogether 19,892 restorations in three Finnish age cohorts were analysed. Survival curves (Kaplan–Meier) were drawn for each of the restorative materials. Median survival times for amalgam and resin-based composites were more than 15 years in older cohorts. More than 60% of silicate cement restorations were replaced within 5 years, and more than 50% of glass ionomers within 7 years. There was a significant reduction in the longevity of amalgams in the 1980 cohort. Data mining of digital oral heath documents would be a useful tool to analyse survival curves of new restorative materials in a practice-based manner in real-life conditions. }

However, existing proposals often neglect a fundamental aspect of learning: that understanding and learning require an active and constructive exploration of a domain. In this paper, we describe a new method and a tool that use data mining and interactivity to turn the typical search and retrieve dialogue, in which the user asks questions and a system gives answers, into a dialogue that also involves sense-making, in which the user has to become active by constructing a bibliography and a domain model of the search term(s). This model starts from an automatically generated and annotated clustering solution that is iteratively modified by users. The tool is part of an integrated authoring system covering all phases from search through reading and sense-making to writing. Two evaluation studies demonstrate the usability of this interactive and constructive approach, and they show that clusters and groups represent identifiable sub-topics. }

Dealing with multiple databases is essentially different from mining from a single database. In multi-database mining, the global patterns must be obtained by carefully analyzing the local patterns from individual databases. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear method, named \{KEMGP\} (kernel estimation for mining global patterns), to tackle this problem, which adopts kernel estimation to synthesizing local patterns for global patterns. We also adopt a method to divide all the data in different databases according to attribute dimensionality, which reduces the total space complexity. We test our algorithm on a customer management system, where the application is to obtain all globally interesting patterns by analyzing the individual databases. The experimental results show that our method is efficient. }

The used extension to \{PSO\} uses similarity measure for neighborhood and far-neighborhood search to store the global best particles found in multi-objective manner. For the bi-objective problem of rule mining of high accuracy/comprehensibility, the multi-objective approach is intended to allow the \{PSO\} algorithm to return an approximation to the upper accuracy/comprehensibility border, containing solutions that are spread across the border. The experimental results show the efficiency of the algorithm. }

Too often these reports are stored, unread by many who could benefit from them. \{PPR\} reports attempt to document the project experience – both good and bad. If these reports were analysed collectively, they may expose important detail, e.g. recurring problems or examples of good practice, perhaps repeated across a number of projects. However, because most companies do not have the resources to thoroughly examine \{PPR\} reports, either individually or collectively, important insights and opportunities to learn from previous projects, are missed. This research explores the application of knowledge discovery techniques and Text Mining to uncover patterns, associations, and trends from \{PPR\} reports. The results might then be used to address problem areas, enhance processes, and improve customer relationships. A case study related to two construction companies is presented in this paper and knowledge discovery techniques are used to analyse 50 \{PPR\} reports collected during the last three years. The case study has been examined in six contexts and the results show that Text Mining has a good potential to improve overall knowledge reuse and exploitation. }

Recent research has focused on distributed environments where the participants in the system may also be mutually mistrustful. In this paper we discuss the design and security requirements for large-scale privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) systems in a fully distributed setting, where each client possesses its own records of private data. To this end we argue in favor of using some well-known cryptographic primitives, borrowed from the literature on Internet elections. More specifically, our framework is based on the classical homomorphic election model, and particularly on an extension for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also review a recent scheme [Z. Yang, S. Zhong, R.N. Wright, Privacy-preserving classification of customer data without loss of accuracy, in: SDM’ 2005 \{SIAM\} International Conference on Data Mining, 2005] which was the first scheme that used the homomorphic encryption primitive for \{PPDM\} in the fully distributed setting. Finally, we show how our approach can be used as a building block to obtain Random Forests classification with enhanced prediction performance. }

  abstract = {Background Predicting the survival of heart–lung transplant patients has the potential to play a critical role in understanding and improving the matching procedure between the recipient and graft. Although voluminous data related to the transplantation procedures is being collected and stored, only a small subset of the predictive factors has been used in modeling heart–lung transplantation outcomes. The previous studies have mainly focused on applying statistical techniques to a small set of factors selected by the domain-experts in order to reveal the simple linear relationships between the factors and survival. The collection of methods known as ‘data mining’ offers significant advantages over conventional statistical techniques in dealing with the latter's limitations such as normality assumption of observations, independence of observations from each other, and linearity of the relationship between the observations and the output measure(s). There are statistical methods that overcome these limitations. Yet, they are computationally more expensive and do not provide fast and flexible solutions as do data mining techniques in large datasets. Purpose The main objective of this study is to improve the prediction of outcomes following combined heart–lung transplantation by proposing an integrated data-mining methodology. Methods A large and feature-rich dataset (16,604 cases with 283 variables) is used to (1) develop machine learning based predictive models and (2) extract the most important predictive factors. Then, using three different variable selection methods, namely, (i) machine learning methods driven variables—using decision trees, neural networks, logistic regression, (ii) the literature review-based expert-defined variables, and (iii) common sense-based interaction variables, a consolidated set of factors is generated and used to develop Cox regression models for heart–lung graft survival. Results The predictive models’ performance in terms of 10-fold cross-validation accuracy rates for two multi-imputed datasets ranged from 79% to 86% for neural networks, from 78% to 86% for logistic regression, and from 71% to 79% for decision trees. The results indicate that the proposed integrated data mining methodology using Cox hazard models better predicted the graft survival with different variables than the conventional approaches commonly used in the literature. This result is validated by the comparison of the corresponding Gains charts for our proposed methodology and the literature review based Cox results, and by the comparison of Akaike information criteria (AIC) values received from each. Conclusions Data mining-based methodology proposed in this study reveals that there are undiscovered relationships (i.e. interactions of the existing variables) among the survival-related variables, which helps better predict the survival of the heart–lung transplants. It also brings a different set of variables into the scene to be evaluated by the domain-experts and be considered prior to the organ transplantation. }

Although many case studies present retrospective analyses of emerging topics, few studies actually nominate emerging topics for consideration by decision makers. We present a novel approach to identifying emerging topics in science and technology. Two large scale models of the scientific literature, one based on direct citation, and the other based on co-citation, are combined to nominate emerging topics using a difference function that rewards clusters that are new and growing rapidly. The top 25 emergent topics are identified for each year 2007 through 2010. These topics are classified and characterized in various ways in order to understand the motive forces behind their emergence, whether scientific discovery, technological innovation, or exogenous events. Topics are evaluated by searching for recent major awards associated with the topic or its key researchers. The evidence presented suggests that the methodology nominates a viable list of emerging topics suitable for inspection by decision makers. }

For the analysis, we have collected about 4,000,000 tweets before and during the parliamentary election 2013 in Germany, from April until September 2013. It is shown, that new topics appearing in Twitter can be detected right after their occurrence. Moreover, we have compared our results to Google Trends. We observed that the topics emerged earlier in Twitter than in Google Trends. Finally, we show how these topics can be used to extend existing knowledge bases (web ontologies or semantic networks) which are required for concept-level sentiment analysis. For this, we utilized special Twitter hashtags, called sentiment hashtags, used by the German community during the parliamentary election. }

In this paper, we focus on the use of nonparametric statistical inference for analyzing the results obtained in an experiment design in the field of computational intelligence. We present a case study which involves a set of techniques in classification tasks and we study a set of nonparametric procedures useful to analyze the behavior of a method with respect to a set of algorithms, such as the framework in which a new proposal is developed. Particularly, we discuss some basic and advanced nonparametric approaches which improve the results offered by the Friedman test in some circumstances. A set of post hoc procedures for multiple comparisons is presented together with the computation of adjusted p-values. We also perform an experimental analysis for comparing their power, with the objective of detecting the advantages and disadvantages of the statistical tests described. We found that some aspects such as the number of algorithms, number of data sets and differences in performance offered by the control method are very influential in the statistical tests studied. Our final goal is to offer a complete guideline for the use of nonparametric statistical procedures for performing multiple comparisons in experimental studies. }

  abstract = {The prediction of bank performance is an important issue. The bad performance of banks may first result in bankruptcy, which is expected to influence the economics of the country eventually. Since the early 1970s, many researchers had already made predictions on such issues. However, until recent years, most of them have used traditional statistics to build the prediction model. Because of the vigorous development of data mining techniques, many researchers have begun to apply those techniques to various fields, including performance prediction systems. However, data mining techniques have the problem of parameter settings. Therefore, this study applies particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain suitable parameter settings for support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), and to select a subset of beneficial features, without reducing the classification accuracy rate. In order to evaluate the proposed approaches, dataset collected from Taiwanese commercial banks are used as source data. The experimental results showed that the proposed approaches could obtain a better parameter setting, reduce unnecessary features, and improve the accuracy of classification significantly. }

  abstract = {Mining association rules is most commonly seen among the techniques for knowledge discovery from databases (KDD). It is used to discover relationships among items or itemsets. Furthermore, temporal data mining is concerned with the analysis of temporal data and the discovery of temporal patterns and regularities. In this paper, a new concept of up-to-date patterns is proposed, which is a hybrid of the association rules and temporal mining. An itemset may not be frequent (large) for an entire database but may be large up-to-date since the items seldom occurring early may often occur lately. An up-to-date pattern is thus composed of an itemset and its up-to-date lifetime, in which the user-defined minimum-support threshold must be satisfied. The proposed approach can mine more useful large itemsets than the conventional ones which discover large itemsets valid only for the entire database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than the traditional ones in discovering such up-to-date temporal patterns especially when the minimum-support threshold is high. }

During a 5&#xa0;year period (2006–2010) in Iran, an average of 3.4 pillion passengers are killed daily due to motorcycle crashes. This study investigated the main factors influencing crash severity of this group of road users. Method The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method was employed to analyze the injury severity of pillion passengers in Iran over a 4&#xa0;year period (2009–2012). Results The predictive accuracy of the model built with a total of 16 variables was 74%, which showed a considerable improvement compared to previous studies. The results indicate that area type, land use, and injured part of the body (head, neck, etc.) are the most influential factors affecting the fatality of motorcycle passengers. Results also show that helmet usage could reduce the fatality risk among motorcycle passengers by 28%. Practical Applications The findings of this study might help develop more targeted countermeasures to reduce the death rate of motorcycle pillion passengers. }

We defined the book-to-market ratio as the value factor and the return on equity as the growth factor. We used these 2 factors to divide stocks into 4 types: high-value, low-value, high-growth, and low-growth stocks. Furthermore, we explored the change in stock prices and stock returns for these 4 categories before and after the formation of investment portfolios. We also established a dynamic model showing the returns from value stocks and growth stocks, called the exponential decay model. Finally, we used Taiwan Stock Exchange data to examine effectiveness of the model during the period from 1995 to 2009. The results are as follows: first, high-value stocks and low-value stocks exhibit a significantly over-reacting phenomenon. Second, high-growth stocks and low-growth stocks exhibit an obviously under-reacting phenomenon. Third, in each current quarter, high-value stocks exhibit the lowest returns; however, in the subsequent quarter, they have the highest returns, and then demonstrate a slow declining trend in the following quarters. These results showed that the stock market can exhibit a dramatic response to extraordinary information and proved that the stock market requires considerable time to correct themselves from an excessive reaction, thus high-value stocks exhibited a higher return. Fourth, in each current quarter, high-growth stocks had the highest return, followed by a rapidly decreasing trend in the following quarters. The t&#xa0;+&#xa0;3 quarter returns were lower than those of low-growth stocks. This result demonstrated that the stock market does not exhibit an adequate reaction, but still remains rather efficient for routine financial information. Finally, regardless of value stocks or growth stocks, exponential decay models could accurately match with the data. }

We define the collection of each search result and all the Web pages that are linked to the result as a search-result drilldown.

However, when relying on sequence data alone, prediction of the reaction catalyzed by a specific protein sequence is often elusive, and substrate specificity is far from trivial. The present study demonstrated an approach of combining sequence data and structures from distant homologs to target identification of new nitrilases that specifically utilize hindered nitrile substrates like mandelonitrile. A total of 212 non-identical target nitrilases were identified from GenBank. Evolutionary trace and sequence clustering methods were used combinatorily to identify a set of nitrilases with presumably distinct substrate specificities. Selected encoding genes were cloned into Escherichia coli. Recombinant E. coli expressing NitA (gi91784632) from Burkholderia xenovorans \{LB400\} was capable of growth on glutaronitrile or adiponitrile as the sole nitrogen source. Purified NitA exhibited highest activity with mandelonitrile, showing a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 3.6&#xa0;×&#xa0;104&#xa0;M−1&#xa0;s−1. A second nitrilase predicted from our studies from Bradyrhizobium zaponicum \{USDA\} 110 (gi27381513) was likewise shown to prefer mandelonitrile [Zhu, D., Mukherjee, C., Biehl, E.R., Hua, L., 2007. Discovery of a mandelonitrile hydrolase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum \{USDA110\} by rational genome mining. J. Biotechnol. 129 (4), 645–650]. Thus, predictions from sequence analysis and distant superfamily structures yielded enzyme activities with high selectivity for mandelonitrile. These data suggest that similar data mining techniques can be used to identify other substrate-specific enzymes from published, unannotated sequences. }

Several relational knowledge discovery systems have been developed employing various search strategies, heuristics, language pattern limitations and hypothesis evaluation criteria, in order to cope with intractably large search space and to be able to generate high-quality patterns. In this work, an ILP-based concept discovery method, namely Confidence-based Concept Discovery (C2D), is described in which strong declarative biases and user-defined specifications are relaxed. Moreover, this new method directly works on relational databases. In addition to this, a new confidence-based pruning is used in this technique. We also describe how to define and use aggregate predicates as background knowledge in the proposed method. In order to use aggregate predicates, we show how to handle numerical attributes by using comparison operators on them. Finally, we analyze the effect of incorporating unrelated facts for generating transitive rules on the proposed method. A set of experiments are conducted on real-world problems to test the performance of the proposed method. }

However, most of the existing algorithms are designed for discovering frequent subgraphs in a set of labeled graphs only. Also, the few algorithms that find frequent subgraphs in a single labeled graph typically identify subgraphs appearing regionally in the input graph. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is commonly required that the identified frequent subgraphs in a single labeled graph should also be globally distributed. This paper thus fills this crucial void by proposing a new measure, termed G-Measure, to find globally distributed frequent subgraphs, called G-Patterns, in a single labeled graph. Specifically, we first show that the G-Patterns, selected by G-Measure, tend to be globally distributed in the input graph. Then, we present that G-Measure has the downward closure property, which guarantees the G-Measure value of a G-Pattern is not less than those of its supersets. Consequently, a G-Miner algorithm is developed for finding G-Patterns. Experimental results on four synthetic and seven real-world data sets and comparison with the existing algorithms demonstrate the efficacy of the G-Measure and the G-Miner for finding G-Patterns. Finally, an application of the G-Patterns is given. }

A novel ranking mechanism taking temporal opinion quality (TOQ) and relevance into account is developed to meet customers’ information need.

The purpose of topic knowledge maps is to transform high-dimensional objects (topic, paper, and cited frequency) into a 2-dimensional space to help understand complicated relatedness among high-dimensional objects, such as the related degree between an article and a topic. First, we adopt independent chi-square test to examine the independence of topics and apply genetic algorithm to choose topics selection with best fitness value to construct knowledge structures. Additionally, high-dimensional relationships among objects are transformed into a 2-dimensional space using the multi-dimension scaling method. The optimal transformation coordinate matrix is also determined by using a genetic algorithm to preserve the original relations among objects and construct appropriate topic knowledge maps. }

The purpose of association rule mining is the discovery of association relationships or correlations among a set of items. In this paper, we present an efficient way to find the valid association rules among the infrequent items, which is seldom mentioned and whose importance often get ignored by other researchers. We design a new data structure, called Transactional Co-Occurrence Matrix, in short TCOM, by two passing of the original transactional database. Then the occurrence count of the itemsets and valid association rules will be mined based on TCOM, which combines the advantages of both transactional oriented (horizontal) layout and item oriented (vertical) layout of the database. It turns out that any itemsets could be randomly accessed and counted without full scan of either the original database or the TCOM, which significantly improves the efficiency of the mining processes. }

In order to achieve optimal efficiency in a learning process, individual learner’s cognitive learning style should be taken into account. Due to different types of learners using these systems, it is necessary to provide them with an individualized learning support system. However, the design and development of web-based learning environments for people with special abilities has been addressed so far by the development of hypermedia and multimedia based on educational content. In this paper a framework of individual web-based learning system is presented by focusing on learner’s cognitive learning process, learning pattern and activities, as well as the technology support needed. Based on the learner-centered mode and cognitive learning theory, we demonstrate an online course design and development that supports the students with the learning flexibility and the adaptability. The proposed framework utilizes data mining algorithm for representing and extracting a dynamic learning process and learning pattern to support students’ deep learning, efficient tutoring and collaboration in web-based learning environment. And experiments do prove that it is feasible to use the method to develop an individual web-based learning system, which is valuable for further study in more depth. }

Object tracking is an important topic in sensor networks; and the limited power of sensor nodes presents numerous challenges to researchers. Previous studies of energy conservation in sensor networks have considered object movement behavior to be random. However, in some applications, the movement behavior of an object is often based on certain underlying events instead of randomness completely. Moreover, few studies have considered the real-time issue in addition to the energy saving problem for object tracking in sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy named multi-level object tracking strategy (MLOT) for energy-efficient and real-time tracking of the moving objects in sensor networks by mining the movement log. In MLOT, we first conduct hierarchical clustering to form a hierarchical model of the sensor nodes. Second, the movement logs of the moving objects are analyzed by a data mining algorithm to obtain the movement patterns, which are then used to predict the next position of a moving object. We use the multi-level structure to represent the hierarchical relations among sensor nodes so as to achieve the goal of keeping track of moving objects in a real-time manner. Through experimental evaluation of various simulated conditions, the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of both energy efficiency and timeliness. }

We design a compact data structure named \{NDFIT\} to efficiently maintain a dynamically selected set of itemsets. In NDFIT, the nodes are divided into four categories to reduce the redundant computational cost based on their properties. Consequently, an optimized algorithm named \{NDFIoDS\} is proposed to generate non-derivable frequent itemsets over stream sliding window. Our experimental results show that this method is effective and more efficient than previous approaches. }

A thorough understanding of the nature and patterns of pathology utilization is an essential requirement for effective decision support for pathology ordering. In this paper a novel methodology for integrating data mining and case-based reasoning for decision support for pathology ordering is proposed. It is demonstrated how this methodology can facilitate intelligent decision support that is both patient-oriented and deeply rooted in practical peer-group evidence. Comprehensive data collected by professional pathology companies provide a system-wide profile of patient-specific pathology requests by various \{GPs\} as opposed to that limited to an individual \{GP\} practice. Using the real data provided by \{XYZ\} Pathology Company in Australia that contain more than 1.5 million records of pathology requests by general practitioners (GPs), we illustrate how knowledge extracted from these data through data mining with Kohonen’s self-organizing maps constitutes the base that, with further assistance of modern data visualization tools and on-line processing interfaces, can provide “peer-group consensus” evidence support for solving new cases of pathology test ordering problem. The conclusion is that the formal methodology that integrates case-based reasoning principles which are inherently close to GPs’ daily practice, and data-driven computationally intensive knowledge discovery mechanisms which can be applied to massive amounts of the pathology requests data routinely available at professional pathology companies, can facilitate more informed evidential decision making by doctors in the area of pathology ordering. }

This interest base is further shown on an interest map via the self-organizing map algorithm (SOM). By comparing the personalized interest map, the original search results from a keyword search engine are re-ranked.

  abstract = {Abstract Mining of the genome for lipid genes has since the early 1970s helped to shape our understanding of how triglycerides are packaged (in chylomicrons), repackaged (in very low density lipoproteins; VLDL), and hydrolyzed, and also how remnant and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are cleared from the circulation. Gene discoveries have also provided insights into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis and remodeling. Interestingly, at least half of these key molecular genetic studies were initiated with the benefit of prior knowledge of relevant proteins. In addition, multiple important findings originated from studies in mouse, and from other types of non-genetic approaches. Although it appears by now that the main lipid pathways have been uncovered, and that only modulators or adaptor proteins such as those encoded by LDLRAP1, APOA5, ANGPLT3/4, and \{PCSK9\} are currently being discovered, genome wide association studies (GWAS) in particular have implicated many new loci based on statistical analyses; these may prove to have equally large impacts on lipoprotein traits as gene products that are already known. On the other hand, since 2004 – and particularly since 2010 when massively parallel sequencing has become de rigeur – no major new insights into genes governing lipid metabolism have been reported. This is probably because the etiologies of true Mendelian lipid disorders with overt clinical complications have been largely resolved. In the meantime, it has become clear that proving the importance of new candidate genes is challenging. This could be due to very low frequencies of large impact variants in the population. It must further be emphasized that functional genetic studies, while necessary, are often difficult to accomplish, making it hazardous to upgrade a variant that is simply associated to being definitively causative. Also, it is clear that applying a monogenic approach to dissect complex lipid traits that are mostly of polygenic origin is the wrong way to proceed. The hope is that large-scale data acquisition combined with sophisticated computerized analyses will help to prioritize and select the most promising candidate genes for future research. We suggest that at this point in time, investment in sequence technology driven candidate gene discovery could be recalibrated by refocusing efforts on direct functional analysis of the genes that have already been discovered.

Information disclosure plays a key role in all of the governance mechanisms. With good information disclosure, the asymmetric information and the agency cost between the insider and the outsider of firms can be reduced effectively. However, the information disclosure status of listed companies is hard to be evaluated or judged by investors before the annual official announcement is reported in the next year. The main purpose of this study is to explore the hidden knowledge of information disclosure status among the listed companies in Taiwan’s stock market. In this paper, we employed decision tree-based mining techniques to explore the classification rules of information transparency levels of the listed firms in Taiwan’s stock market. Moreover, the multi-learner model constructed by boosting ensemble approach with decision tree algorithm has been applied. The numerical results show that the classification accuracy has been improved by using multi-leaner model in terms of less Type I and Type \{II\} errors. In particular, the extracted rules from the data mining approach can be developed as a computer model for the prediction or the classification of good/poor information disclosure potential and like expert systems. }

Previous work only considers that influence is propagated through the network with a uniform probability. However, because users actually have different preferences on topics, such a uniform propagation can result in inaccurate results. To solve this problem, we have designed a two-stage mining algorithm (GAUP) to mine the most influential nodes in a network on a given topic. Given a set of users’ documents labeled with topics, \{GAUP\} first computes user preferences with a latent feature model based on \{SVD\} or a model based on vector space. Then to find top- K nodes in the second stage, \{GAUP\} adopts a greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution within 63% of the optimal. Our evaluation on the task of expert finding shows that \{GAUP\} performs better than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm, SVD-based collaborative filtering, and HITS. }

Moreover, the paper shows that the explanatory potential of discovered contrast sets can be improved by offering additional contrast set descriptors, called the supporting factors.

  abstract = {As the business environment has become increasingly complex, the demand for environmental scanning to assist company managers plan strategies and responses has grown significantly. The conventional technique for supporting environmental scanning is event detection from text documents such as news stories. Event detection methods recognize events, but neglect to discover the changes brought about by the events. In this work, we propose an event change detection (ECD) approach that combines association rule mining and change mining techniques. The approach detects changes caused by events to help managers respond rapidly to changes in the external environment. Association rule mining is used to discover event trends (the subject patterns of events) from news stories. The changes can be identified by comparing event trends in different time periods. The empirical evaluation showed that the discovered event changes can support decision-makers by providing up-to-date information about the business environment, which enables them to make appropriate decisions. The proposed approach is practical for business managers to be aware of environmental changes and adjust their business strategies accordingly. }

In practice, due to the large number of blocks and precedence constraints linking them, blocks are typically aggregated to form larger scheduling units. We aim to solve the OPMPSP, formulated as a mixed integer programme (MIP), so that aggregates are used to schedule the mining process, while individual blocks are used for processing decisions. We propose an iterative disaggregation method that refines the aggregates (with respect to processing) up to the point where the refined aggregates defined for processing produce the same optimal solution for the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the \{MIP\} as the optimal solution of the \{LP\} relaxation with individual block processing. We propose several strategies of creating refined aggregates for the \{MIP\} processing, using duality results and exploiting the problem structure. These refined aggregates allow the solution of very large problems in reasonable time with very high solution quality in terms of NPV. }

In this paper, a mining approach is proposed to discover the structural and temporal model for a workflow from its timed running logs. The mining results are represented in the formalized form of Petri nets extended with two timing factors that allows validation or verification the actual behaviors, especially the temporal constraints between activities. According to the reachability graph of the extended Petri net model mined, all running schemas of a workflow can be generated, which defines the temporal constraints between running activities. By calculating the earliest and latest start time of each activity, the earliest starting and latest existing time of each state in the running schema can be determined. Based on the temporal relations between the timing factors of each running state, the running schemas can be classified into six classes. The effects of the six classes of running schemas on the implementation of the whole workflow are evaluated so as to obtain the best one that can ensure the workflow is finished in the shortest time. The standards for the ideal, reliable and favorable running schemas and their existence conditions are discussed, which can be used to evaluate the running logs and control the future running of a workflow. }

The most significant contribution of this research is in dynamically reducing the number of questions while the \{LASSI\} assessment is proceeding. To verify the appliance of the proposed method, a web-based \{LASSI\} self-assessment system (Web-LSA) was developed. This system can be used as a guide to determine study disturbances for high-risk groups, and can provide counselors with fundamental information on which to base follow-up counseling services to its users. }

These electronic functionalities converged devices with powerful contents and functions, such as the World Wide Web, videoconferencing, e-mail, internet telephony, online gaming, digital television, and net banking, are easier to use than traditional computers but not less capable of performing daily tasks. These information technology revolutions along with rapid growing of network technology not only increased the amount of internet applications and digital contents, but also led to diversified consumer behaviors, increased competition, and opportunities. On the other hand, one-to-one marketing is different from traditional marketing methods because it focuses on customer satisfaction and is customer-oriented rather than focusing on marketing mass consumers; thus a one-to-one marketer tries to find more different products and services for the same customer. Therefore, how to establish potential cross-selling and one-to-one offers through product mix analysis, enhance relationship with customers by means of personalized offers through product knowledge, and understand users’ needs and making useful suggestions for new product developments and one-to-one marketing become critical issues to information appliance firms. This paper proposes association rules, clustering analysis and \{CART\} as methodologies of data-mining, which is implemented for mining product and marketing knowledge from information users. Knowledge extraction from information users is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, clusters, and trees in order to propose suggestions on one-to-one marketing for information appliance firms. }

In this work, we introduce a new exact concise representation of frequent itemsets. This representation is based on an exploration of the disjunctive search space. The disjunctive itemsets convey information about the complementary occurrence of items in a dataset. A novel closure operator is then devised to suit the characteristics of the explored search space. The proposed operator aims at mapping many disjunctive itemsets to a unique one, called a disjunctive closed itemset. Hence, it permits to drastically reduce the number of handled itemsets within the targeted re-presentation. Interestingly, the proposed representation offers direct access to the disjunctive and negative supports of frequent itemsets while ensuring the derivation of their exact conjunctive supports. We conclude from the experimental results reported and discussed here that our representation is effective and sound in comparison with different other concise representations. }

With the help of alliances, businesses can bring to bear significant resources beyond the capabilities of the individual co-operating firms.

This paper proposes the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining, which is implemented for mining marketing map knowledge from customers. Knowledge extraction from marketing maps is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules in order to propose suggestions for business alliances and possible co-operation solutions.

However, these studies mainly use statistical methods to analyze learners’ preferences. In this paper, we propose to analyze learners’ preferences with a data mining technique. Findings in our study show that Field Independent learners frequently use backward/forward buttons and spent less time for navigation. On the other hand, Field Dependent learners often use main menu and have more repeated visiting. Implications for these findings are discussed. }

The temporal high utility itemsets are the itemsets whose support is larger than a pre-specified threshold in current time window of the data stream. Discovery of temporal high utility itemsets is an important process for mining interesting patterns like association rules from data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely \{THUI\} (Temporal High Utility Itemsets)-Mine, for mining temporal high utility itemsets from data streams efficiently and effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on mining temporal high utility itemsets from data streams. The novel contribution of THUI-Mine is that it can effectively identify the temporal high utility itemsets by generating fewer candidate itemsets such that the execution time can be reduced substantially in mining all high utility itemsets in data streams. In this way, the process of discovering all temporal high utility itemsets under all time windows of data streams can be achieved effectively with less memory space and execution time. This meets the critical requirements on time and space efficiency for mining data streams. Through experimental evaluation, THUI-Mine is shown to significantly outperform other existing methods like Two-Phase algorithm under various experimental conditions. }

This case adds to London and Hart's social embeddedness strategy for multi-national enterprises (MNEs) working in developing nations by introducing a locally-based community interaction model, which we describe as a local legitimacy strategy, in an effort to bring about sustainable development in the communities that surround a MNE's production activities. The components of our local legitimacy strategy include co-analysis of community needs by \{MNEs\} and community partners, and planning and investment in developments to enhance the social fabric and the physical infrastructure needs of communities. The developing world is getting better at publicizing and monitoring the work of MNEs. We argue that it will be increasingly necessary for MNEs, like Newmont, to add local sustainable benefit into their strategic mix to gain the social license and legitimacy that is needed to operate in poorer communities. }

  abstract = {In this paper we use a large firm-level dataset to extend previous studies by augmenting the endogenous growth accounting framework with a data mining technique to analyze the complex relationships between the use of \{IT\} and organizational practices. There is emerging evidence of recent emphasis on organizational factors and a greater shift towards “IT complementarities” in which value addition is linked to combining complementary organizational practices with \{IT\} investments. Our findings indicate that the set of interrelated organizational practices that complement positively to \{IT\} use is different from the set of practices hindering \{IT\} use. The presence of clustering among organizational practices clearly implies that some combinations of practices make it difficult to precisely empirical examine. We have found that our technique was able to show some organizational factors may have different pathways to affect organizational performance and such organizational practices have often been overlooked but can play a weak yet non-trivial role in production and organizational processes. }

  abstract = {To support biomedical experts in their knowledge discovery process, we have developed a literature mining method called RaJoLink for identification of relations between biomedical concepts in disconnected sets of articles. The method implements Swanson’s \{ABC\} model approach for generating hypotheses in a new way. The main novelty is a semi-automated suggestion of candidates for agents a that might be logically connected with a given phenomenon c under investigation. The choice of candidates for a is based on rare terms identified in the literature on c. As rare terms are not part of the typical range of information, which describe the phenomenon under investigation, such information might be considered as unusual observations about the phenomenon c. If literatures on these rare terms have an interesting term in common, this joint term is declared as a candidate for a. Linking terms b between literature on a and literature on c are then searched for in the closed discovery to provide additional supportive evidence for uncovered connections. We have applied the method to the literature on autism and have used \{MEDLINE\} as a source of data. Expert evaluation has confirmed that the discovered relations might contribute to a better understanding of autism. }

This paper, in terms of the disadvantage of traditional extracting models, imports domain knowledge from practice and experience, converts semantic knowledge into digital information, and proposes a new model for the specific task. By selecting Luan mining area as study area, this new model is tested based on \{GIS\} and related knowledge.

Several authoring tools have been developed to help users tackling this task. However, manual or semi-automatic authoring is implausible when we intend to annotate large amount of Web pages. In this work, we proposed a method to automatically generate some descriptive metadata and tags for a Web page. The idea is to apply the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster the Web pages and discover the relationships between these clusters. In the mean time, the themes of each cluster are also identified. We then use such relationships and themes to tag the Web pages and generate metadata for the Web pages. The result of experiments shows that our method may generate semantically relevant metadata and tags for the Web pages. }

In particular, the growth of business blogs that are written by or provide commentary on businesses and companies opens up new opportunities for developing blog-specific search and mining techniques. In this paper, we propose probabilistic models for blog search and mining using two machine learning techniques, latent semantic analysis (LSA) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). We implement the models in our database of business blogs, BizBlogs07, with the aim of achieving higher precision and recall. The probabilistic model is able to segment the business blogs into separate topic areas, which is useful for keywords detection on the blogosphere. Various term-weighting schemes and factor values were also studied in detail, which reveal interesting patterns in our database of business blogs. Our multi-functional business blog system is indeed found to be very different from existing blog search engines, as it aims to provide better relevance and precision of the search. }

The influence of normal and shear stresses on fault activation and effective shear stress distribution in the fault plane was acquired under mining conditions. Using fracture mechanics theory to calculate the stress intensity factor of an insidious fault front, we have derived the criterion for main fault activation. Results indicate that during the whole working face advance, transpressions are exerted on fault planes twice successively in opposite directions. In most cases, the second transpression is more likely to lead to fault activation. Activation is influenced by many factors, predominant among which are: burial depth of the insidious fault, friction angle of the fault plane, face advance direction and pore water pressure. Steep fault planes are more easily activated to induce a sustained water inrush in the face. }

This paper provides a survey of the intersection of operations research and data mining. The primary goals of the paper are to illustrate the range of interactions between the two fields, present some detailed examples of important research work, and provide comprehensive references to other important work in the area. The paper thus looks at both the different optimization methods that can be used for data mining, as well as the data mining process itself and how operations research methods can be used in almost every step of this process. Promising directions for future research are also identified throughout the paper.

  abstract = {The operating status of an enterprise is disclosed periodically in a financial statement. As a result, investors usually only get information about the financial distress a company may be in after the formal financial statement has been published. If company executives intentionally package financial statements with the purpose of hiding the actual status of the company, then investors will have even less chance of obtaining the real financial information. For example, a company can manipulate its current ratio by up to 200% so that its liquidity deficiency will not show up as a financial distress in the short run. To improve the accuracy of the financial distress prediction model, this paper adopted the operating rules of the Taiwan stock exchange corporation (TSEC) which were violated by those companies that were subsequently stopped and suspended, as the range of the analysis of this research. In addition, this paper also used financial ratios, other non-financial ratios, and factor analysis to extract adaptable variables. Moreover, the artificial neural network (ANN) and data mining (DM) techniques were used to construct the financial distress prediction model. The empirical experiment with a total of 37 ratios and 68 listed companies as the initial samples obtained a satisfactory result, which testifies for the feasibility and validity of our proposed methods for the financial distress prediction of listed companies. This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) The more factor analysis we used, the less accuracy we obtained by the \{ANN\} and \{DM\} approach. (2) The closer we get to the actual occurrence of financial distress, the higher the accuracy we obtain, with an 82.14% correct percentage for two seasons prior to the occurrence of financial distress. (3) Our empirical results show that factor analysis increases the error of classifying companies that are in a financial crisis as normal companies. (4) By developing a financial distress prediction model, the \{ANN\} approach obtains better prediction accuracy than the \{DM\} clustering approach. Therefore, this paper proposes that the artificial intelligent (AI) approach could be a more suitable methodology than traditional statistics for predicting the potential financial distress of a company. }

  abstract = {Process mining techniques have been receiving great attention in the literature for their ability to automatically support process (re)design. Typically, these techniques discover a concrete workflow schema modelling all possible execution patterns registered in a given log, which can be exploited subsequently to support further-coming enactments. In this paper, an approach to process mining is introduced that extends classical discovery mechanisms by means of an abstraction method aimed at producing a taxonomy of workflow models. The taxonomy is built to capture the process behavior at different levels of detail. Indeed, the most-detailed mined models, i.e., the leafs of the taxonomy, are meant to support the design of concrete workflows, as it happens with existing techniques in the literature. The other models, i.e., non-leaf nodes of the taxonomy, represent instead abstract views over the process behavior that can be used to support advanced monitoring and analysis tasks. All the techniques discussed in the paper have been implemented, tested, and made available as a plugin for a popular process mining framework (ProM). A series of tests, performed on different synthesized and real datasets, evidenced the capability of the approach to characterize the behavior encoded in input logs in a precise and complete way, achieving compelling conformance results even in the presence of complex behavior and noisy data. Moreover, encouraging results have been obtained in a real-life application scenario, where it is shown how the taxonomical view of the process can effectively support an explorative ex-post analysis, hinged on the different kinds of process execution discovered from the logs. }

When learning from imbalanced data in which most examples are labeled as one class and only few belong to another class, traditional data mining approaches do not have a good ability to predict the crucial minority instances. Unfortunately, many real world data sets like health examination, inspection, credit fraud detection, spam identification and text mining all are faced with this situation. In this study, we present a novel model called the “Information Granulation Based Data Mining Approach” to tackle this problem. The proposed methodology, which imitates the human ability to process information, acquires knowledge from Information Granules rather then from numerical data. This method also introduces a Latent Semantic Indexing based feature extraction tool by using Singular Value Decomposition, to dramatically reduce the data dimensions. In addition, several data sets from the \{UCI\} Machine Learning Repository are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results show that our method can significantly increase the ability of classifying imbalanced data. }

Most techniques in mining association rules nowadays are designed to solve problems based on transaction files transformed to horizontal or vertical format. Namely, the transaction-normalized tables should be transformed before such methods could be applied, and some previous works have pointed out that such tasks of performing data transformation usually consume a lot of resources. As a result, traditionally, data mining technique has seldom being applied in real-time. However, in many cases, the decisions have to be made in a short time, such as the decisions of promoting fresh agriculture goods in retailing stores should be made daily and in the limit of one or two hours. This study therefore proposes a new method which incorporates mining algorithms with enterprise transaction databases directly to perform real-time mining. In addition, the proposed method has following advantages to support real-time mining performed in enterprise systems: • raw data of enterprise systems are used directly, • when the threshold is tuned, only newly qualified data are read and the data structure built for original data is kept intact, • product assortments centered on particular product can be effectively performed, • the performance of the mining algorithm is better than that of popular mining algorithms. }

In an empirical comparison on three real-world public datasets, the rule-based models produced by AntMiner+ are shown to achieve a predictive accuracy that is competitive to that of the models induced by several other included classification techniques, such as C4.5, logistic regression and support vector machines. In addition, we will argue that the intuitiveness and comprehensibility of the AntMiner+ models can be considered superior to the latter models. }

In the first stage, a sequence classification model is defined, based on a set of sequential patterns and two sets of weights are introduced, one for the patterns and one for classes. In the second stage, an optimization technique is employed to estimate the weight values and achieve optimal classification accuracy. Extensive evaluation of the methodology is carried out, by varying the number of sequences, the number of patterns and the number of classes and it is compared with similar sequence classification approaches. }

Given the concern regarding quality sustainability in the food supply chain, much attention is being paid to continuous planning and monitoring of quality assurance practices in the supply chain network. In this research, we propose a supply chain quality sustainability decision support system (QSDSS), adopting association rule mining and Dempster's rule of combination techniques. The aim of \{QSDSS\} is to support managers in food manufacturing firms to define good logistics plans in order to maintain the quality and safety of food products. We conduct a case study of a Hong Kong red wine company in order to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of QSDSS. Implications of the proposed approach are discussed, and suggestions for future work are outlined. }

The problem of e-mail authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are supported by a strong evidence. }

Much security research addresses reducing fraud opportunity and increasing fraud detection, but detecting motivational factors like employee disgruntlement is less studied. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act requires that companies archive email, creating an untapped resource for deterring fraud. Herein, protocols to identify disgruntled communications are developed. Messages cluster well according to disgruntled content, giving confidence in the value of email for this task. A highly accurate naïve Bayes model predicts whether messages contain disgruntled communications, providing extremely relevant information not otherwise likely to be revealed in a fraud audit. The model can be incorporated into fraud risk analysis systems to improve their ability to detect and deter fraud. }

We adopt a dynamic approach that is able to absorb new and recent trends in web usage trends on search engines, while forgetting outdated trends, thus adapting to dynamic changes in web user’s interests. In order to get well-rounded recommendations, we combine two methods: first, we model search engine users’ sequential search behavior, and interpret this consecutive search behavior as client-side query refinement, that should form the basis for the search engine’s own query refinement process. This query refinement process is exploited to learn useful information that helps generate related queries. Second, we combine this method with a traditional text or content based similarity method to compensate for the shortness of query sessions and sparsity of real query log data. }

Grid environments can be used both for compute-intensive tasks and data intensive applications by exploiting their resources, services, and data access mechanisms. Data mining algorithms and knowledge discovery processes are both compute and data intensive, therefore the grid can offer a computing and data management infrastructure for supporting decentralized and parallel data analysis.

These mobility data serve as an important foundation for understanding individuals’ mobility behaviors. For instance, recent studies show that, despite the dissimilarity in the mobility areas covered by individuals, there is high regularity in the human mobility behaviors, suggesting that most individuals follow a simple and reproducible pattern. This survey paper reviews relevant results on uncovering mobility patterns from \{GPS\} datasets. Specially, it covers the results about inferring locations of significance for prediction of future moves, detecting modes of transport, mining trajectory patterns and recognizing location-based activities. The survey provides a general perspective for studies on the issues of individuals’ mobility by reviewing the methods and algorithms in detail and comparing the existing results on the same issues. Several new and emergent issues concerning individuals’ mobility are proposed for further research. }

Furthermore, it is difficult to model uncertain behavior of energy consumption with only conventional fuzzy system or time series and the integrated algorithm could be an ideal substitute for such cases. To construct fuzzy systems, a rule base is needed. Because a rule base is not available, for the case of demand function, look up table which is one of the extracting rule methods is used to extract the rule base. This system is defined as FLT. Also, decision tree method which is a data mining approach is similarly utilized to extract the rule base. This system is defined as FDM. Preferred time series model is selected from linear (ARMA) and nonlinear model. For this, after selecting preferred \{ARMA\} model, McLeod–Li test is applied to determine nonlinearity condition. When, nonlinearity condition is satisfied, preferred nonlinear model is selected and compare with preferred \{ARMA\} model and finally one of this is selected as time series model. At last, \{ANOVA\} is used for selecting preferred model from fuzzy models and time series model. Also, the impact of data preprocessing and postprocessing on the fuzzy system performance is considered by the algorithm. In addition, another unique feature of the proposed algorithm is utilization of autocorrelation function (ACF) to define input variables, whereas conventional methods which use trial and error method. Monthly electricity consumption of Iran from 1995 to 2005 is considered as the case of this study. The \{MAPE\} estimation of genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN) versus the proposed algorithm shows the appropriateness of the proposed algorithm. }

First, extension courses were classified into five broad groups. Records of enrollees in extension courses from 2000-5 were then analyzed by three data mining algorithms: Decision Tree, Link Analysis, and Decision Forest. Decision tree was used to find enrollee course preferences, Link Analysis found the correlation between course category and enrollee profession, and Decision Forest found the probability of enrollees completing preferred courses. Results will be used as a reference for curriculum development in the extension program. }

In frequent pattern mining, closed frequent pattern mining and weighted frequent pattern mining are two main approaches to reduce the search space. Although many related studies have been suggested, no mining algorithm considers both paradigms. Even if closed frequent pattern mining represents exactly the same knowledge and weighted frequent pattern mining provides a way to discover more important patterns, the incorporation of closed frequent pattern mining and weight frequent pattern mining may loss information. Based on our analysis of joining orders, we propose closed weighted frequent pattern mining, and present how to discover succinct but lossless closed frequent pattern with weight constraints. To our knowledge, ours is the first work specifically to consider both constraints. An extensive performance study shows that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms. In addition, it is efficient and scalable. }

The development of more complex analytical instruments and the need to cope with larger experimental data sets have demanded for new approaches in data analysis, which have led to advanced methods in experimental design and data processing. Hypothesis-driven methods typified by inferential statistics have been gradually complemented or even replaced by data-driven model-free methods that seek for structure in data without reference to the experimental protocol or prior hypotheses. The emphasis is put on the ability of data mining methods to solve multivariate–multiresponse problems on the basis of experimental data and minimal statistical assumptions only, in contrast to classical methods, which require predefined priors to be tested against some null-hypothesis. }

In this paper, an automatic concept map construction technique, Fuzzy Association Concept Mapping (FACM), is proposed for the conversion of abstracted short texts into concept maps. The approach consists of a linguistic module and a recommendation module. The linguistic module is a text mining method that does not require the use to have any prior knowledge about using \{NLP\} techniques. It incorporates rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case based reasoning (CBR) for anaphoric resolution. It aims at extracting the propositions in text so as to construct a concept map automatically. The recommendation module is arrived at by adopting fuzzy set theories. It is an interactive process which provides suggestions of propositions for further human refinement of the automatically generated concept maps. The suggested propositions are relationships among the concepts which are not explicitly found in the paragraphs. This technique helps to stimulate individual reflection and generate new knowledge. Evaluation was carried out by using the Science Citation Index (SCI) abstract database and \{CNET\} News as test data, which are well known databases and the quality of the text is assured. Experimental results show that the automatically generated concept maps conform to the outputs generated manually by domain experts, since the degree of difference between them is proportionally small. The method provides users with the ability to convert scientific and short texts into a structured format which can be easily processed by computer. Moreover, it provides knowledge workers with extra time to re-think their written text and to view their knowledge from another angle. }

Many of these techniques are far more flexible than more classical modelling approaches and could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Clustering, Case-Based Reasoning and more recently Bayesian Decision Networks have found application in environmental modelling while other methods, for example classification and association rule extraction, have not yet been taken up on any wide scale. We propose that these and other data mining techniques could be usefully applied to difficult problems in the field. The chapter is a general introduction to Data Mining techniques for Environmental Scientists who may be interested in using them in their applications. So the presentation focuses on the contributions of data mining techniques to environmental applications and on general guidelines of good practice in real world domains. The purpose of this chapter is not to present technical details on specific data mining techniques, but rather to provide general guidance to non-expert users to help them decide which technique is appropriate for solving their problem.

It suggests that text mining can be used as a stand-alone tool for the analysis of free-text descriptions of occupational injury or combined with coded data to investigate sub-categories of injury. By manipulating the original description of the injury, text-mining can offer more detailed analyses of certain types of claim and shifts the focus of strategic prevention from broad statistics or coded groups of information to the descriptions people use to explain their injuries and accidents. }

This paper is about practices with data in epidemiological research, based on a case study in Denmark. I propose an epistemology of record linkage that invites exploration of epidemiological studies as heterogeneous assemblages. Focusing on data collecting, sampling and linkage, I examine how data organisation and processing become productive beyond the context of their collection. The case study looks at how a local population database established in 1976 to investigate possibilities for the prevention of cardiovascular disease is used thirty years later to test hypotheses on the aetiology of breast cancer. For two breast cancer investigations based on the same core data set, I follow the underlying record linkage practice and describe how research objects such as molecular markers become relevant with respect to public health through information networking. Epidemiological association studies function as tools that performatively enrol different contexts into statistical risk estimation, thereby configuring options for research as well as for clinical testing and public health policy. }

The first stage employs the ant system-based clustering algorithm (ASCA) and ant K-means (AK) to cluster the database, while the ant colony system-based association rules mining algorithm is applied to discover the useful rules for each group. The medical database provided by the National Health Insurance Bureau of Taiwan Government is used to verify the proposed method. The evaluation results showed that the proposed method not only is able to extract the rules much faster, but also can discover more important rules. }

Hence, businesses should develop products that fulfill the customer demands, since this will increase the enterprise’s competitiveness and it is an essential criterion to earning higher loyalties and profits. This paper presents the product map obtained from data mining results, which investigates the relationships among customer demands, product characteristics, and transaction records, using the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining. The product map shows that different knowledge patterns and rules can be extracted from customers to develop new cosmetic products and possible marketing solutions. Accordingly, this paper suggests that the cosmetics industry should extract customer knowledge from the demand side and use this as a knowledge resource on its supply chain for new product development. }

One of essential outcomes of our theory is high understandability of the found associations because when formulated in natural language they are much closer to the way of thinking of experts from various fields. Moreover, associations characterizing real dependencies can be directly taken as fuzzy IF–THEN rules and used as expert knowledge about the problem. }

Key information, such as distinctive menu items, navigation indicators, which is embedded in web pages, can help classify the main contents of web pages and reflect certain taxonomy knowledge. Therefore, mining key information is significant in helping acquire domain knowledge and build catalogue classifiers. Current web content mining methods cannot mine such key information effectively. “Noise information” (such as advertisements) is a problem for the performance of web mining tasks. This paper proposes a method to extract key information out of web pages which contain noisy information. The method contains two steps: to extract a list of candidate key information, and then apply entropy measure to filter noisy information and discover key information. Experiment results show that this method is effective in discovering key information. With the discovered key information that reflects taxonomy knowledge, an application is developed to help ontology generation. }

The proposed framework was applied to a set of 20 sources of documents over a period of 8&#xa0;months. After the analysis period and that the proposed experiments were run, an F-Measure of 0.56 was obtained for the detection of significant events, implying that the proposed framework is a feasible model of how trends could be represented through the analysis of documents freely available on the Web. }

For example, the audit trails of a workflow management system or the transaction logs of an enterprise resource planning system can be used to discover models describing processes, organizations, and products. Traditionally, process mining has been applied to structured processes. In this paper, we argue that process mining can also be applied to less structured processes supported by computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. In addition, the ProM framework is described. Using ProM a wide variety of process mining activities are supported ranging from process discovery and verification to conformance checking and social network analysis. }

  abstract = {Multi-database mining using local pattern analysis could be considered as an approximate method of mining multiple large databases. Thus, it might be required to enhance the quality of knowledge synthesized from multiple databases. Also, many decision-making applications are directly based on the available local patterns in different databases. The quality of synthesized knowledge/decision based on local patterns in different databases could be enhanced by incorporating more local patterns in the knowledge synthesizing/processing activities. Thus, the available local patterns play a crucial role in building efficient multi-database mining applications. We represent patterns in condensed form by employing a coding called \{ACP\} coding. It allows us to consider more local patterns by lowering further the user inputs, like minimum support and minimum confidence. The proposed coding enables more local patterns participate in the knowledge synthesizing/processing activities and thus, the quality of synthesized knowledge based on local patterns in different databases gets enhanced significantly at a given pattern synthesizing algorithm and computing resource. }

Both asymptotic theory and simulation results reveal the effectiveness of penalization as a data mining tool for longitudinal data, especially when a large number of variables is present. The method is illustrated by mining for the main determinants of life expectancy in Europe. }

For example, while designing adaptive learning materials, designers need to refer to the concept map of a subject domain. Moreover, concept maps can show the whole picture and core knowledge about a subject domain. Research from literature also suggests that graphical representation of domain knowledge can reduce the problems of information overload and learning disorientation for learners. However, construction of concept maps typically relied upon domain experts in the past; it is a time consuming and high cost task. Concept maps creation for emerging new domains such as e-Learning is even more challenging due to its ongoing development nature. The aim of this paper is to construct e-Learning domain concept maps from academic articles. We adopt some relevant journal articles and conference papers in e-Learning domain as data sources, and apply text-mining techniques to automatically construct concept maps for e-Learning domain. The constructed concept maps can provide a useful reference for researchers, who are new to the e-Leaning field, to study related issues, for teachers to design adaptive learning materials, and for learners to understand the whole picture of e-Learning domain knowledge. }

This study aims to fill the gap by developing a data mining framework based on decision tree and association rules to generate useful rules for personnel selection. The results can provide decision rules relating personnel information with work performance and retention. An empirical study was conducted in a semiconductor company to support their hiring decision for indirect labors including engineers and managers with different job functions. The results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. Moreover, based on discussions among domain experts and data miner, specific recruitment and human resource management strategies were created from the results. }

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for automatically mining a high-quality case base from a raw case set that can preserve and sometimes even improve the competence of case-based reasoning. In this paper, we analyze two major problems in previous case-mining algorithms. The first problem is caused by noisy cases such that the nearest neighbor cases of a problem may not provide correct solutions. The second problem is caused by uneven case distribution, such that similar problems may have dissimilar solutions. To solve these problems, we develop a theoretical framework for the error bound in case-based reasoning, and propose a novel case-base mining algorithm guided by the theoretical results that returns a high-quality case base from raw data efficiently. We support our theory and algorithm with extensive empirical evaluation using different benchmark data sets. }

We extend a well-known user-controlled tool, based on regular expressions constraints, to the multi-sequential pattern context. This specification tool enables the incorporation of user focus into the mining process.

PeerRush achieves these results without the need of deep packet inspection, and can accurately identify applications that use encrypted \{P2P\} traffic. We implemented a prototype version of PeerRush and performed an extensive evaluation of the system over a variety of \{P2P\} traffic datasets. Our results show that we can detect all the considered types of \{P2P\} traffic with up to 99.5% true positives and 0.1% false positives. Furthermore, PeerRush can attribute the \{P2P\} traffic to a specific \{P2P\} application with a misclassification rate of 0.68% or less. }

This paper proposes a novel data mining approach for exploring hierarchical tree structures, named tree-like patterns, representing the relationships for a pair of items in a sequence. Using tree-like patterns, the relationships for a pair of items can be identified in terms of the cause and effect. A novel technique that efficiently counts support values for tree-like patterns using a queue structure is proposed. In addition, this paper addresses an efficient scheme for determining the frequency of a tree-like pattern in a sequence using a dynamic programming approach. Each tree-like pattern embedded in a sequence is considered to have a certain valuable meaning or the degree of importance used in different applications. Two addressed formulas are applied to determine the degree of significance for a specific sequence, which denotes the degree of consecutive items in a tree-like pattern for a sequence. The larger the degree of significance a tree-like pattern has, the more the tree-like pattern is compacted in the sequence. The characteristics differentiating the explored patterns from those obtained with other schemes are discussed. A simulation analysis of the proposed data mining approach is utilized to demonstrate its efficacy. Finally, the proposed approach is designed and implemented in a data mining system integrated into a novel e-learning platform. }

Specifically, we propose QuMinS, a fast, scalable solution to two problems: (i) Low-labor labeling (LLL) – given an image set, very few images have labels, find the most appropriate labels for the rest; and (ii) Mining and attention routing – in the same setting, find clusters, the top- N O outlier images, and the N R images that best represent the data. Experiments on satellite images spanning up to 2.25 \{GB\} show that, contrasting to the state-of-the-art labeling techniques, QuMinS scales linearly on the data size, being up to 40 times faster than top competitors (GCap), still achieving better or equal accuracy, it spots images that potentially require unpredicted labels, and it works even with tiny initial label sets, i.e., nearly five examples. We also report a case study of our method’s practical usage to show that QuMinS is a viable tool for automatic coffee crop detection from remote sensing images. }

We extract translation knowledge based on Term Association Network (TAN) constructed from term co-occurrences in same language as well as term associations in different languages. We further propose a post-processing step to do term translation validity check by detecting the mistranslated terms as outliers. Evaluation results on two different data sets show that translating queries using \{UTPECC\} and using the proposed methods significantly outperform simple dictionary-based methods. Moreover, the experimental results show that our methods are especially effective in translating Out-Of-Vocabulary terms and also expanding query words based on their associated terms. }

Earlier work on generalized association rules confined the minimum supports to be uniformly specified for all items or for items within the same taxonomy level. This constraint on minimum support would restrain an expert from discovering some deviations or exceptions that are more interesting but much less supported than general trends. In this paper, we extended the scope of mining generalized association rules in the presence of taxonomies to allow any form of user-specified multiple minimum supports. We discuss the problems of using classic Apriori itemset generation and presented two algorithms, MMS_Cumulate and MMS_Stratify, for discovering the generalized frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluation showed that these two algorithms are very effective and have good linear scale-up characteristics. }

The resulting sequence representations allow for calculation of vector-based distances (dissimilarities) between Web user sessions and thus can be used as inputs of various clustering algorithms. We develop an evaluation framework in which the performances of the algorithms are compared in terms of whether the clusters (groups of Web users who follow the same Markov process) are correctly identified using a replicated clustering approach. A series of experiments is conducted to investigate whether clustering performance is affected by different sequence representations and different distance measures as well as by other factors such as number of actual Web user clusters, number of Web pages, similarity between clusters, minimum session length, number of user sessions, and number of clusters to form. A new, fuzzy ART-enhanced K-means algorithm is also developed and its superior performance is demonstrated. }

Commonly used dating models (CIC-CSR, CRS) were applied to Torch Lake, but assumptions of these methods are violated, rendering sediment geochronologies inaccurate. A modification was made to the \{CRS\} model, utilizing a distinct horizon separating mining from post-mining sediment to differentiate between two focusing regimes. 210Pb inventories in post-mining sediment were adjusted to correspond to those in mining-era sediment, and a sediment geochronology was established and verified using independent markers in 137Cs accumulation profiles and core X-rays. }

However, in reality, the documents are rarely static. In this paper, we propose a novel research problem called \{XML\} structural delta mining. The objective of \{XML\} structural delta mining is to discover knowledge by analyzing structural evolution pattern (also called structural delta) of history of \{XML\} documents. Unlike existing approaches, \{XML\} structural delta mining focuses on the dynamic and temporal features of \{XML\} data. Furthermore, the data source for this novel mining technique is a sequence of historical versions of an \{XML\} document rather than a set of snapshot \{XML\} documents. Such mining technique can be useful in many applications such as change detection for very large \{XML\} documents, efficient \{XML\} indexing, \{XML\} search engine, etc. Our aim in this paper is not to provide a specific solution to a particular mining problem. Rather, we present the vision of the mining framework and present the issues and challenges for three types of \{XML\} structural delta mining: identifying various interesting structures, discovering association rules from structural deltas, and structural change pattern-based classification. }

  abstract = {SummaryObjective The amount of biomedical data in different disciplines is growing at an exponential rate. Integrating these significant knowledge sources to generate novel hypotheses for systems biology research is difficult. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a completely different discipline, and is a complementary knowledge system to modern biomedical science. This paper uses a significant \{TCM\} bibliographic literature database in China, together with MEDLINE, to help discover novel gene functional knowledge. Materials and methods We present an integrative mining approach to uncover the functional gene relationships from \{MEDLINE\} and \{TCM\} bibliographic literature. This paper introduces \{TCM\} literature (about 50,000 records) as one knowledge source for constructing literature-based gene networks. We use the \{TCM\} diagnosis, \{TCM\} syndrome, to automatically congregate the related genes. The syndrome–gene relationships are discovered based on the syndrome–disease relationships extracted from \{TCM\} literature and the disease–gene relationships in MEDLINE. Based on the bubble-bootstrapping and relation weight computing methods, we have developed a prototype system called MeDisco/3S, which has name entity and relation extraction, and online analytical processing (OLAP) capabilities, to perform the integrative mining process. Results We have got about 200,000 syndrome–gene relations, which could help generate syndrome-based gene networks, and help analyze the functional knowledge of genes from syndrome perspective. We take the gene network of Kidney–Yang Deficiency syndrome (KYD syndrome) and the functional analysis of some genes, such as \{CRH\} (corticotropin releasing hormone), \{PTH\} (parathyroid hormone), \{PRL\} (prolactin), \{BRCA1\} (breast cancer 1, early onset) and \{BRCA2\} (breast cancer 2, early onset), to demonstrate the preliminary results. The underlying hypothesis is that the related genes of the same syndrome will have some biological functional relationships, and will constitute a functional network. Conclusion This paper presents an approach to integrate \{TCM\} literature and modern biomedical data to discover novel gene networks and functional knowledge of genes. The preliminary results show that the novel gene functional knowledge and gene networks, which are worthy of further investigation, could be generated by integrating the two complementary biomedical data sources. It will be a promising research field through integrative mining of \{TCM\} and modern life science literature. }

The objective of this paper is to illustrate the ability of \{SA\} to develop an accurate fuzzy classifier. The use of \{SA\} in classification is an attempt to effectively explore and exploit the large search space usually associated with classification problems, and find the optimum set of fuzzy if–then rules. The \{SAFCS\} would be capable to extract accurate fuzzy classification rules from input data sets, and applies them to classify new data instances in different predefined groups or classes. Experiments are performed with eight \{UCI\} data sets. The results indicate that the proposed \{SAFCS\} achieves competitive results in comparison with several well-known classification algorithms. }

Recently, the object concept has been very popular and used in a variety of applications, especially for complex data description. This paper thus proposes a new data-mining algorithm for extracting interesting knowledge from transactions stored as object data. Each item itself is thought of as a class, and each item purchased in a transaction is thought of as an instance. Instances with the same class (item name) may have different attribute values since they may appear in different transactions. The proposed algorithm is divided into two main phases, one for intra-object association rules, and the other for inter-object association rules. Two apriori-like procedures are adopted to find the two kinds of rules. The first phase finds out the association relation within the same kind of objects. Each large itemset found in this phase can be thought of as a composite item used in phase 2. The second phase then finds the relationship among different kinds of objects. Both the intra-object and inter-object association rules can thus be easily derived by the proposed algorithm at the same time. Experiments are also made to show the effect of the proposed algorithm. }

Approximations of a concept by rough set theory need updating for data mining or other related tasks. For incremental updating approximations of a concept, methods using the tolerance relation and similarity relation have been previously studied in literature. The characteristic relation-based rough sets approach provides more informative results than the tolerance-and-similarity relation based approach. In this paper, an attribute generalization and its relation to feature selection and feature extraction are firstly discussed. Then, a new approach for incrementally updating approximations of a concept is presented under the characteristic relation-based rough sets. Finally, the approach of direct computation of rough set approximations and the proposed approach of dynamic maintenance of rough set approximations are employed for performance comparison. An extensive experimental evaluation on a large soybean database from \{MLC\} shows that the proposed approach effectively handles a dynamic attribute generalization in data mining. }

Data mining is a widely used approach for the transformation of data to useful patterns, aiding the comprehensive knowledge of the concrete domain information. Nevertheless, traditional data mining techniques find difficulties in their application on current scenarios, due to the complexity previously mentioned. Data Mining Grid tries to fix these problems, allowing data mining process to be deployed in a grid environment, in which data and services resources are geographically distributed, belong to several virtual organizations and the security can be flexibly solved.

Unfortunately, for prediction of topic trend, the availability of data is always very limited owing to the short life circle of topics, especially in such a highly efficient and fast-paced era. Based on Grey Verhulst Model, the paper presents an algorithm to predict topics trend. The principle of Grey Model for prediction application is analyzed and Grey Verhulst Model is established. In the meanwhile, real-world data from Youku (the largest video site in China and something like YouTube) is applied to test our presented algorithm. The average relative error of Grey Verhulst Model is less than 3%. The results show that Grey Verhulst Model has a higher prediction precision. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we introduce Grey System Theory (GST) originated from system theory to the prediction of topics trend and to some extent, solve the problem with a high accuracy; second, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to employ \{GST\} in the field of topic trend prediction. }

We consider \{WCDMA\} (wideband code division multiple access) systems with two-branch \{STTD\} (space time transmit diversity) and 1/2 rate convolutional coding (forward error correction codes). Monte Carlo simulation estimates the bit error probability (BEP) of the system across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A performance database of simulation runs is collected over a targeted space of system configurations. This database is then mined to obtain regions of the configuration space that exhibit acceptable average performance. The shape of the mined regions illustrates the joint influence of configuration parameters on system performance. The role of data mining in this application is to provide explainable and statistically valid design conclusions. The research issue is to define statistically meaningful aggregation of data in a manner that permits efficient and effective data mining algorithms. We achieve a good compromise between these goals and help establish the applicability of data mining for characterizing wireless systems performance. }

  abstract = {The Internet is one of the fastest growing areas of intelligence gathering. We present a statistical approach, called principal clusters analysis, for analyzing millions of user navigations on the Web. This technique identifies prominent navigation clusters on different topics. Furthermore, it can determine information items that are useful starting points to explore a topic, as well as key documents to explore the topic in greater detail. Trends can be detected by observing navigation prominence over time. We apply this technique on a large popular website. The results show promise in web intelligence mining. }

In particular, it is argued that while right dislocation involves clausal ellipsis when the dislocated element is accompanied with Case-markers/postpositions, it is derived from what is called the bare-topic construction when the dislocated element is not accompanied with Case-markers/postpositions. Then, it is illustrated that the bare-topic construction, where the topic element is base-generated in the sentence-initial position without any Case-marker, postposition, or the topic-marker -wa, has close similarities with Hanging Topic constructions found in Romance and other languages. Claiming that the bare-topic construction should be equated with Hanging Topic constructions, this paper argues that an investigation of the properties of Japanese right dislocation makes it possible to contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of the bare-topic construction, which in turn opens a novel way of comparing Japanese with other languages in terms of the syntax of topics. }

To study this, this paper proposes two sets of topic attributes to examine topic dynamic characteristics: topic continuity and topic popularity. Topic continuity comprises six attributes: steady, concentrating, diluting, sporadic, transforming, and emerging topics; topic popularity comprises three attributes: rising, declining, and fluctuating topics. These attributes are applied to a data set on library and information science publications during the past 11 years (2001–2011). Results show that topics on “web information retrieval”, “citation and bibliometrics”, “system and technology”, and “health science” have the highest average popularity; topics on “h-index”, “online communities”, “data preservation”, “social media”, and “web analysis” are increasingly becoming popular in library and information science. }

Engineers who rely on personal domain knowledge cannot find possible root causes of defects rapidly and effectively. This study aims to develop a framework for data mining and knowledge discovery from database that consists of a Kruskal–Wallis test, K-means clustering, and the variance reduction splitting criterion to investigate the huge amount of semiconductor manufacturing data and infer possible causes of faults and manufacturing process variations. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers as a basis for trouble shooting and defect diagnosis. We validated this approach with an empirical study in a semiconductor foundry company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. }

In this paper we have presented an ontology-based Biological Information Extraction and Query Answering (BIEQA) System, which initiates text mining with a set of concepts stored in a biological ontology, and thereafter mines possible biological relations among those concepts using \{NLP\} techniques and co-occurrence-based analysis. The system extracts all frequently occurring biological relations among a pair of biological concepts through text mining. A mined relation is associated to a fuzzy membership value, which is proportional to its frequency of occurrence in the corpus and is termed a fuzzy biological relation. The fuzzy biological relations extracted from a text corpus along with other relevant information components like biological entities occurring within a relation, are stored in a database. The database is integrated with a query-processing module. The query-processing module has an interface, which guides users to formulate biological queries at different levels of specificity. }

In political science researchers are using party manifestos and transcripts of political speeches to analyze the positions of different actors. Existing approaches are limited to a single dimension, in particular, they cannot distinguish between the positions with respect to a specific topic. In this paper, we propose a method for analyzing and comparing documents according to a set of predefined topics that is based on an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for inducing knowledge about relevant topics. We validate the method by showing that it can guess which member of a coalition was assigned a certain ministry based on a comparison of the parties' election manifestos with the coalition contract. We apply the method to German National Elections since 1990 and show that the use of our method consistently outperforms a baseline method that simulates manual annotation of individual sentences based on keywords and standard text comparison. In our experiments, we compare two different extensions of \{LDA\} and investigate the influence of the used seed set. Finally, we give a brief illustration of how the output of our method can be interpreted to compare positions towards specific topics across several parties. }

Users cannot easily obtain results from only interesting portion of data. This may prevent the usage of mining from online decision support for multidimensional data. To provide ad-hoc, query-driven, and online mining support, we first propose a relation called the multidimensional pattern relation to structurally and systematically store context and mining information for later analysis. Each tuple in the relation comes from an inserted dataset in the database. We then develop an online mining approach called three-phase online association rule mining (TOARM) based on this proposed multidimensional pattern relation to support online generation of association rules under multidimensional considerations. The \{TOARM\} approach consists of three phases during which final sets of patterns satisfying various mining requests are found. It first selects and integrates related mining information in the multidimensional pattern relation, and then if necessary, re-processes itemsets without sufficient information against the underlying datasets. Some implementation considerations for the algorithm are also stated in detail. Experiments on homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets were made and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

This market mechanism allows selection between multiple instances of services based on operations required in a data mining task (such as data migration, data pre-processing and subsequently data analysis). Catallaxy is a decentralized approach, based on a “free market” mechanism, and is particularly useful when the number of market participants is large or when conditions within the market often change. It is therefore particularly suitable in Grid and peer-2-peer systems. The approach assumes that the service provider and user are not co-located, and require multiple message exchanges to carry out a data mining task. A market of J48-based decision tree algorithm instances, each implemented as a Web service, is used to demonstrate our approach. We have validated the feasibility of building catallactic data mining grid applications, and implemented a proof-of-concept application (Cat-COVITE) mapped to a catallactic Grid middleware. }

While scalable data mining methods are expected to cope with the size challenge, coping with evolving trends in noisy data in a continuous fashion, and without any unnecessary stoppages and reconfigurations is still an open challenge. This dynamic and single pass setting can be cast within the framework of mining evolving data streams. The harsh restrictions imposed by the “you only get to see it once” constraint on stream data calls for different computational models that may furthermore bring some interesting surprises when it comes to the behavior of some well known similarity measures during clustering, and even validation. In this paper, we study the effect of similarity measures on the mining process and on the interpretation of the mined patterns in the harsh single pass requirement scenario. We propose a simple similarity measure that has the advantage of explicitly coupling the precision and coverage criteria to the early learning stages. Even though the cosine similarity, and its close relative such as the Jaccard measure, have been prevalent in the majority of Web data clustering approaches, they may fail to explicitly seek profiles that achieve high coverage and high precision simultaneously. We also formulate a validation strategy and adapt several metrics rooted in information retrieval to the challenging task of validating a learned stream synopsis in dynamic environments. Our experiments confirm that the performance of the MinPC similarity is generally better than the cosine similarity, and that this outperformance can be expected to be more pronounced for data sets that are more challenging in terms of the amount of noise and/or overlap, and in terms of the level of change in the underlying profiles/topics (known sub-categories of the input data) as the input stream unravels. In our simulations, we study the task of mining and tracking trends and profiles in evolving text and Web usage data streams in a single pass, and under different trend sequencing scenarios. }

We created a text mining tool that analyzes the PubMed literature database and integrates the available genomic information to provide a detailed mapping of the genes and their interrelationships within a particular network such as osteoporosis. The results obtained from our text mining program show that existing genomic data within the PubMed database can effectively be used to predict potentially novel target genes for osteoporosis research that have not previously been reported in the literature. To filter the most significant findings, we developed a ranking system to rate our predicted novel genes. Some of our predicted genes ranked higher than those currently studied, suggesting that they may be of particular interest from a therapeutic standpoint. A preliminary analysis of the current biomedical literature in our research area using our tool suggests that S100A12, as well as a group of \{SMAD\} genes previously unstudied in relation to osteoporosis, may be highly relevant to the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates, that the function of osteocytes may be influenced by a family of important interleukins and interleukin-related molecules, and that the \{FYN\} oncogene may play an important role in regulating the apoptosis of bone cells in the context of degenerative bone diseases. An evaluation of our tool's predictive ability with an analysis of PubMed literature published before the year 2000 in the area of osteoporosis research shows that many of its top-rated novel target genes from that analysis were later studied and shown to be relevant to osteoporosis in the period between 2000 and 2006. We believe that our tool will be beneficial to researchers in the field of orthopaedics seeking to identify novel target genes in their research area, and it will allow them to delve deeper into the complex interplay between genes, biological systems and diseases. }

The existing solution for vertically partitioned data leaks a significant amount of information, while the existing solution for horizontally partitioned data only works for three parties or more. In this paper, we design algorithms for both vertically and horizontally partitioned data, with cryptographically strong privacy. We give two algorithms for vertically partitioned data; one of them reveals only the support count and the other reveals nothing. Both of them have computational overheads linear in the number of transactions. Our algorithm for horizontally partitioned data works for two parties and above and is more efficient than the existing solution. }

  abstract = {Semantic Web Mining aims at combining the two fast-developing research areas Semantic Web and Web Mining. This survey analyzes the convergence of trends from both areas: More and more researchers are working on improving the results of Web Mining by exploiting semantic structures in the Web, and they make use of Web Mining techniques for building the Semantic Web. Last but not least, these techniques can be used for mining the Semantic Web itself. The Semantic Web is the second-generation WWW, enriched by machine-processable information which supports the user in his tasks. Given the enormous size even of today’s Web, it is impossible to manually enrich all of these resources. Therefore, automated schemes for learning the relevant information are increasingly being used. Web Mining aims at discovering insights about the meaning of Web resources and their usage. Given the primarily syntactical nature of the data being mined, the discovery of meaning is impossible based on these data only. Therefore, formalizations of the semantics of Web sites and navigation behavior are becoming more and more common. Furthermore, mining the Semantic Web itself is another upcoming application. We argue that the two areas Web Mining and Semantic Web need each other to fulfill their goals, but that the full potential of this convergence is not yet realized. This paper gives an overview of where the two areas meet today, and sketches ways of how a closer integration could be profitable. }

  abstract = {Summary This paper describes a novel approach to river flood prediction using Time Series Data Mining which combines chaos theory and data mining to characterize and predict events in complex, nonperiodic and chaotic time series. Geophysical phenomena, including earthquakes, floods and rainfall, represent a class of nonlinear systems termed chaotic, in which the relationships between variables in a system are dynamic and disproportionate, however completely deterministic. Chaos theory provides a structured explanation for irregular behavior and anomalies in systems that are not inherently stochastic. While nonlinear approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Nonlinear Prediction are useful in forecasting of daily discharge values in a river, the focus of these approaches is on forecasting magnitudes of future discharge values rather than the prediction of floods. The described Time Series Data Mining methodology focuses on the prediction of events where floods constitute the events in a river daily discharge time series. The methodology is demonstrated using data collected at the St. Louis gauging station located on the Mississippi River in the USA. Results associated with the impact of earliness of prediction and the acceptable risk-level vs. prediction accuracy are presented. }

In the field of education, faculty can take advantage of these new technologies for the design of pedagogical contents. The face-to-face observation of behavioral patterns allows faculty to detect and track new problems, and to apply possible corrections which would improve the learning/teaching process. However, with a distance methodology, these observations are not possible. When forums are created they are intended to discuss particular topics. It is relevant to monitor that the topics discussed are the intended ones in order to achieve course objectives. To tackle this shortcoming, our work studies the dynamics of relevant topics in on-line asynchronous discussion forums, and this is done by analyzing the large amount of students’ interactions generated in the forums of our Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we analyze the students’ behavior patterns in the forums of a distance subject, and characterize the relevant topics and subtopics from the forums’ messages belonging to two academic years. From the statistical and graphical results obtained, a set of valuable recommendations are also given. }

Ziarko thus proposed the variable precision rough-set model to deal with noisy data and uncertain information. This model allowed for some degree of uncertainty and misclassification in the mining process. Conventionally, the mining algorithms based on the rough-set theory identify the relationships among data using crisp attribute values; however, data with quantitative values are commonly seen in real-world applications. This paper thus deals with the problem of producing a set of fuzzy certain and fuzzy possible rules from quantitative data with a predefined tolerance degree of uncertainty and misclassification. A new method, which combines the variable precision rough-set model and the fuzzy set theory, is thus proposed to solve this problem. It first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set of linguistic terms using membership functions and then calculates the fuzzy β-lower and the fuzzy β-upper approximations. The certain and possible rules are then generated based on these fuzzy approximations. These rules can then be used to classify unknown objects. The paper thus extends the existing rough-set mining approaches to process quantitative data with tolerance of noise and uncertainty. }

First, we define the notion of stable items according to two constraint conditions, minsupp and varivalue. We then measure the similarity between stable items based on gray relational analysis, and present a hierarchical gray clustering method for mining stable patterns consisting of stable items. Finally, experiments are conducted on four datasets, and the results of the experiments show that our method is useful and efficient. }

We explain why data fusion of sufficiently dissimilar retrieval lists can improve weak query results and confirm this with experiments using short and medium size queries. To realize sufficiently dissimilar retrieval lists, we propose composing alternate queries through web search and mining, employ them for target retrieval, and combine with the original query retrieval list. Methods of forming web probes from longer queries, including salient term selection and query text window rotation, are investigated. When compared with normal ad hoc retrieval, web assistance and data fusion can more than double the original weak query effectiveness. Other queries can also improve along with weak ones. }

Here we propose a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora from Wikipedia articles. We also introduce a method for extracting truly parallel sentences that are filtered out from noisy or just comparable sentence pairs. We describe our implementation of a specialized tool for this task as well as training and adaption of a machine translation system that supplies our filter with additional information about the similarity of comparable sentence pairs. }

This growth makes it very difficult to filter the most relevant results, and thus the extraction of the core information becomes very expensive. Therefore, there is a growing interest in text processing approaches that can deliver selected information from scientific publications, which can limit the amount of human intervention normally needed to gather those results. Materials and methods This paper presents and evaluates an approach aimed at automating the process of extracting functional relations (e.g. interactions between genes and proteins) from scientific literature in the biomedical domain. The approach, using a novel dependency-based parser, is based on a complete syntactic analysis of the corpus. Results We have implemented a state-of-the-art text mining system for biomedical literature, based on a deep-linguistic, full-parsing approach. The results are validated on two different corpora: the manually annotated genomics information access (GENIA) corpus and the automatically annotated arabidopsis thaliana circadian rhythms (ATCR) corpus. Conclusion We show how a deep-linguistic approach (contrary to common belief) can be used in a real world text mining application, offering high-precision relation extraction, while at the same time retaining a sufficient recall. }

Existing mining classifiers need to be updated frequently to adapt to the changes in data streams. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an adaptive ensemble approach for classification and novel class detection in concept drifting data streams. The proposed approach uses traditional mining classifiers and updates the ensemble model automatically so that it represents the most recent concepts in data streams. For novel class detection we consider the idea that data points belonging to the same class should be closer to each other and should be far apart from the data points belonging to other classes. If a data point is well separated from the existing data clusters, it is identified as a novel class instance. We tested the performance of this proposed stream classification model against that of existing mining algorithms using real benchmark datasets from \{UCI\} (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results prove that our approach shows great flexibility and robustness in novel class detection in concept drifting and outperforms traditional classification models in challenging real-life data stream applications. }

Firstly, they are computer-intensive such that they can hardly be used for massive data sets, say with millions of data points. Secondly, robust and non-parametric confidence intervals for the predictions according to the fitted models are often unknown. A simple but general method is proposed to overcome these problems in the context of huge data sets. An implementation of the method is scalable to the memory of the computer and can be distributed on several processors to reduce the computation time. The method offers distribution-free confidence intervals for the median of the predictions. The main focus is on general support vector machines (SVM) based on minimizing regularized risks. As an example, a combination of two methods from modern statistical machine learning, i.e. kernel logistic regression and ε -support vector regression, is used to model a data set from several insurance companies. The approach can also be helpful to fit robust estimators in parametric models for huge data sets. }

  abstract = {Abstract Clinical text, such as clinical trial eligibility criteria, is largely underused in state-of-the-art medical search engines due to difficulties of accurate parsing. This paper proposes a novel methodology to derive a semantic index for clinical eligibility documents based on a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags, which are automatically mined from the text. We applied this method to eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov and report that frequent tags (1) define an effective and efficient index of clinical trials and (2) are unlikely to grow radically when the repository increases. We proposed to apply the semantic index to filter clinical trial search results and we concluded that frequent tags reduce the result space more efficiently than an uncontrolled set of \{UMLS\} concepts. Overall, unsupervised mining of frequent tags from clinical text leads to an effective semantic index for the clinical eligibility documents and promotes their computational reuse. }

  abstract = {Abstract Use of data generated through social media for health studies is gradually increasing. Twitter is a short-text message system developed 6 years ago, now with more than 100 million users generating over 300 million Tweets every day. Twitter may be used to gain real-world insights to promote healthy behaviors. The purposes of this paper are to describe a practical approach to analyzing Tweet contents and to illustrate an application of the approach to the topic of physical activity. The approach includes five steps: (1) selecting keywords to gather an initial set of Tweets to analyze; (2) importing data; (3) preparing data; (4) analyzing data (topic, sentiment, and ecologic context); and (5) interpreting data. The steps are implemented using tools that are publically available and free of charge and designed for use by researchers with limited programming skills. Content mining of Tweets can contribute to addressing challenges in health behavior research. }

Methods The study was based on the \{OECD\} database from the period 2000 to 2006. The data of thirty countries were constructed to allow comparisons over time and across these countries. Panel data analysis was used to estimate the relationship of national education, as defined as school years, with life expectancy. The control factors considered were numbers of practicing physicians, practicing nurses, hospital beds, and GDP. Results We used fixed effects of both country and time through linear regression, the coefficient of school years in relation to life expectancy was statistically significant but negative. This finding is not in accord with the hypothesis that investing in human capital through education stimulates better health outcomes. Conclusion Within developing countries, educational attainment is no longer keeping the same pace with life expectancy as before. Therefore, we suggest that an effective education policy should cover diverse topics, for example, balancing economic growth and mental hygiene, to improve national life expectancy. }

Three different wavelet algorithms are simulated and applied on nine classes of power signal time series, which primarily belongs to an important problem area called electric power quality. In contrast to the wavelet analysis, the paper presents a new approach called S-transform-based time frequency analysis in processing power quality disturbance data. Certain pertinent feature vectors are extracted using the well-known wavelet methods and the new approach using S-transform. Neural networks are then used to compute the classification accuracy of the feature vectors. Certain characteristics of the wavelet feature vectors are apparent from the results. Further in large data sets partitioning is done and similarities of pattern vectors present in different sections are determined. The approach is a general one and can be applied to pattern classification, similarity determination, and knowledge discovery in time varying data patterns occurring in many practical sciences and engineering problems. }

Among such markers is a paradigm of periphrastic topic presenters that are built on rhetorical questions, bringing micro-level topics into the discourse. The major strategy involved in the development of these topic presenters is feigning interactivity, whereby the speaker rhetorically asks a hypothetical question on behalf of the addressee and then answers it. This rhetorical question strategy is an intriguing discourse manipulation to create an engaging effect in that what the speaker pursues from the addressee is not a verbal response, i.e. reply, but a cognitive response, i.e. attention. A historical investigation reveals a number of important implications in grammaticalization studies. For instance, the grammaticalization process of these innovative topic markers creates a template-like paradigm of periphrastic constructions that contain slots to be filled in from another grammatical paradigm of interrogative pronouns and adverbs. Furthermore, the historical developmental pattern of the emerging paradigm strongly suggests that the formative process is enabled by analogy. In addition, the directionality of the process is from the domain of discourse, i.e. rhetoric, contra most traditional instances that undergo the process proceeding from lexical domain to grammatical domain. }

  abstract = {It is commonly recognized that there are constraints to successful regional-scale assessment and monitoring of cumulative impacts because of challenges in the selection of coherent and measurable indicators of the effects. It has also been sensibly declared that the connections between components in a region are as important as the state of the elements themselves. These have previously been termed “linked” cumulative impacts/effects. These connections can be difficult to discern because of a complicated set of interactions and unexpected linkages. In this paper we diagnose that a significant cause of these constraints is the selection of indicators without due regard for their inter-relationships in the formulation of the indicator set. The paper examines whether the common “forms of capital”, i.e., natural (renewable and non-renewable), manufactured, social, human and financial capitals, framework is a potential organizing structure. We examine a large region in western \{NSW\} Australia where the predominant production systems are mining and grazing for production of wool, beef and lamb. Production in both is driven by consumption of a non-renewable resource, i.e., ore for mining and topsoil for grazing, the latter on the basis that loss rate estimates far exceed soil formation rates. We propose that the challenge of identifying connections of components within and between capital stores can be approached by explicitly separating stores of capital and the flows of capital between stores and between elements within stores, so-called capital fluxes. We attempt to acquire data from public sources for both capital stores and fluxes. The question of whether these data are a sufficient base for regional assessment, with particular reference to connections, is discussed. The well-described challenge of a comparative common currency for stores and fluxes is also discussed. We conclude that the data acquisition is relatively successful for stores and fluxes. A number of linked impacts are identified and discussed. The potential use of money as the common currency for stores and fluxes of capital is considered. The basic proposition is that replacement or preservation costs be used for this. We conclude that the study is sufficiently positive to consider further research in fully-coupled models of capital stores and fluxes. }

Conventional approaches like providing abstracts and lists of keywords have proven to be insufficient. For more than thirty years already, meta-analysis is available for the accumulation and dissemination of scientific knowledge. In the social sciences, meta-analysis has been used on a limited scale only, mainly because there still remains a gap between the knowledge available and its application in policymaking. Recently, value transfer has been introduced as an additional method to bridge the gap between available knowledge and the demands for knowledge in new problem areas. Not only in the social sciences but also in the information sciences non-utilization of information is a major problem. It is the mission of tech mining to contribute to a mitigation of this non-utilization. In this article, we will show how tech mining could profit from innovations in meta-analysis and social impact assessment. Special attention will be paid to research on technology generations, research on social change in cohesive social systems showing solidarity at work, and tech mining in support of the Lisbon Strategy of the European Commission. }

Mining, in real-time, the connection of these distributed data fragments provides a key advantage not only to deliver enriched views, but also to gain insight into interesting sociological aspects. To this aim, we harness the power of Semantic Web technologies as means to easily steer the data integration and analysis. Our overall goal is to build a web-based environment that allows users to discover meaningful, surprising or entertaining connections between events, media and people. In this paper, we present EventMedia, a platform that provides descriptions of events associated with media, and interlinked with the Linked Data cloud. It draws on a live data update and a real-time interlinking to face the natural dynamics of events. A user-friendly interface has been designed to meet the user needs: relive experiences based on media and support decision making for attending upcoming events. }

We assume that the user movement data are collected by logging location data emitted from mobile devices tracking users. We formally define group pattern as a group of users that are within a distance threshold from one another for at least a minimum duration. To mine group patterns, we first propose two algorithms, namely \{AGP\} and VG-growth. In our first set of experiments, it is shown when both the number of users and logging duration are large, \{AGP\} and VG-growth are inefficient for the mining group patterns of size two. We therefore propose a framework that summarizes user movement data before group pattern mining. In the second series of experiments, we show that the methods using location summarization reduce the mining overheads for group patterns of size two significantly. We conclude that the cuboid based summarization methods give better performance when the summarized database size is small compared to the original movement database. In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the mining overhead. }

To improve living conditions in Guinea, changes will be needed to be made throughout the commodity chain for aluminum, solutions which also involve consumer countries. }

Everyone is free to express their opinions and emotions very easily through blogs. In the blogosphere, many communities have emerged, which include hate groups and racists that are trying to share their ideology, express their views, or recruit new group members. It is important to analyze these virtual communities, defined based on membership and subscription linkages, in order to monitor for activities that are potentially harmful to society. While many Web mining and network analysis techniques have been used to analyze the content and structure of the Web sites of hate groups on the Internet, these techniques have not been applied to the study of hate groups in blogs. To address this issue, we have proposed a semi-automated approach in this research. The proposed approach consists of four modules, namely blog spider, information extraction, network analysis, and visualization. We applied this approach to identify and analyze a selected set of 28 anti-Blacks hate groups (820 bloggers) on Xanga, one of the most popular blog hosting sites. Our analysis results revealed some interesting demographical and topological characteristics in these groups, and identified at least two large communities on top of the smaller ones. The study also demonstrated the feasibility in applying the proposed approach in the study of hate groups and other related communities in blogs. }

New search engines that use link structures have produced improved search results which can overcome the limitations of conventional text-based search engines. Going a step further, this paper presents a system that provides users with personalized results derived from a search engine that uses link structures. The fuzzy document retrieval system (constructed from a fuzzy concept network based on the user's profile) personalizes the results yielded from link-based search engines with the preferences of the specific user. A preliminary experiment with six subjects indicates that the developed system is capable of searching not only relevant but also personalized web pages, depending on the preferences of the user. }

  abstract = {AbstractObjectives Process model comparison and similar process retrieval is a key issue to be addressed in many real-world situations, and a particularly relevant one in medical applications, where similarity quantification can be exploited to accomplish goals such as conformance checking, local process adaptation analysis, and hospital ranking. In this paper, we present a framework that allows the user to: (i) mine the actual process model from a database of process execution traces available at a given hospital; and (ii) compare (mined) process models. The tool is currently being applied in stroke management. Methods Our framework relies on process mining to extract process-related information (i.e., process models) from data. As for process comparison, we have modified a state-of-the-art structural similarity metric by exploiting: (i) domain knowledge; (ii) process mining outputs and statistical temporal information. These changes were meant to make the metric more suited to the medical domain. Results Experimental results showed that our metric outperforms the original one, and generated output closer than that provided by a stroke management expert. In particular, our metric correctly rated 11 out of 15 mined hospital models with respect to a given query. On the other hand, the original metric correctly rated only 7 out of 15 models. The experiments also showed that the framework can support stroke management experts in answering key research questions: in particular, average patient improvement decreased as the distance (according to our metric) from the top level hospital process model increased. Conclusions The paper shows that process mining and process comparison, through a similarity metric tailored to medical applications, can be applied successfully to clinical data to gain a better understanding of different medical processes adopted by different hospitals, and of their impact on clinical outcomes. In the future, we plan to make our metric even more general and efficient, by explicitly considering various methodological and technological extensions. We will also test the framework in different domains. }

A better understanding of travel patterns and regularity at the “magnitude” level will enable transit authorities to evaluate the services they offer, adjust marketing strategies, retain loyal customers and improve overall transit performance. However, it is fairly challenging to identify travel patterns for individual transit riders in a large dataset. This paper proposes an efficient and effective data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing, China. Transit riders’ trip chains are identified based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of their smart card transaction data. The Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm then analyzes the identified trip chains to detect transit riders’ historical travel patterns and the K-Means++ clustering algorithm and the rough-set theory are jointly applied to cluster and classify travel pattern regularities. The performance of the rough-set-based algorithm is compared with those of other prevailing classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed rough-set-based algorithm outperforms other commonly used data-mining algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. }

Customs authorities and international traders need a \{HS\} code query tool to make their processing efficient and automatic. Since \{HS\} codes are identified at 5–7 levels of classification, then any intelligent coding service will need to combine a knowledge database, with the techniques of data mining, machine learning and semantics reasoning. In this paper, the authors propose a comprehensive solution for such a coding service. The architecture, related techniques, technical solution and implementation considerations for the proposed system have been provided. Several of the proposed functions and implementation techniques have been developed and deployed by the Shanghai International Airport Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau. The coding service has been published as a Web service, and has the potential to be widely used by authorities and international traders around the world. The proposed system may also be appropriate for other applications that relate to code or classification processes, such as RFID-based or product ontology based applications. }

Similarly, Topic Drop is solely responsible for the missing object in Hebrew structures which have also received structural analyses involving VP-ellipsis or a moved null operator. We argue against movement analyses of both constructions and propose that missing objects are to be analyzed as unvalued feature bundles that receive an interpretation from an available topic in the discourse. }

The first case uses information obtained from patents and publications to inform traditional out-of-area economic development recruitment strategies in a more knowledge-oriented direction. The second case exemplifies the use of data mining to identify top researchers as part of a strategic state economic development effort. The third case illustrates how local knowledge-based capabilities can be identified in cities not traditionally viewed as innovative. Nanotechnology-related knowledge assets in the southern United States are mapped and assessed in the fourth case. Disaggregated methods used in traditional strategies were most intuitively understood and used, but new knowledge measures were found to encourage local and state economic developers to begin to embrace new paradigms. }

Generally, discovery of \{CP\} patterns is a challenging task as treatment behaviors in \{CPs\} often have a large variability depending on factors such as time, location and patient individual. Based on the assumption that \{CP\} patterns can be derived from clinical event logs which usually record various treatment activities in \{CP\} executions, this study proposes a novel approach to \{CP\} pattern discovery by modeling \{CPs\} using mixtures of an extension to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation family that jointly models various treatment activities and their occurring time stamps in CPs. Clinical case studies are performed to evaluate the proposed approach via real-world data sets recording typical treatment behaviors in patient careflow. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach for \{CP\} pattern discovery, and indicate the promise in research efforts related to \{CP\} analysis and optimization. }

Understanding software change messages described by the unstructured nature-language text is one of the fundamental challenges in mining these messages in repositories. Objective We seek to present a novel automatic change message classification method characterized by semi-supervised topic semantic analysis. Method In this work, we present a semi-supervised \{LDA\} based approach to automatically classify change messages. We use domain knowledge of software changes to make labeled samples which are added to build the semi-supervised \{LDA\} model. Next, we verify the cross-project analysis application of our method on three open-source projects. Our method has two advantages over existing software change classification methods: First of all, it mitigates the issue of how to set the appropriate number of latent topics. We do not have to choose the number of latent topics in our method, because it corresponds to the number of class labels. Second, this approach utilizes the information provided by the label samples in the training set. Results Our method automatically classified about 85% of the change messages in our experiment and our validation survey showed that 70.56% of the time our automatic classification results were in agreement with developer opinions. Conclusion Our approach automatically classifies most of the change messages which record the cause of the software change and the method is applicable to cross-project analysis of software change messages. }

For this task, we developed a methodology taking as input multi-word terms and lexico-syntactic relations between them. Our clustering algorithm, named \{CPCL\} is implemented in the TermWatch system. We compared \{CPCL\} to other existing clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical and partitioning (k-means, k-medoids). This out-of-context clustering task led us to adapt multi-word term representation for statistical methods and also to refine an existing cluster evaluation metric, the editing distance in order to evaluate the methods. Evaluation was carried out on a list of multi-word terms from the genomic field which comes with a hand built taxonomy. Results showed that while k-means and k-medoids obtained good scores on the editing distance, they were very sensitive to term length. \{CPCL\} on the other hand obtained a better cluster homogeneity score and was less sensitive to term length. Also, \{CPCL\} showed good adaptability for handling very large and sparse matrices. }

  abstract = {This study examines how the discriminatory power of an automated bacterial whole-cell fatty acid identification system can be significantly enhanced by exploring the vast amounts of information accumulated during 15&#xa0;years of routine gas chromatographic analysis of the fatty acid content of aerobic bacteria. Construction of a global peak occurrence histogram based upon a large fatty acid database is shown to serve as a highly informative tool for assessing the delineation of the naming windows used during the automatic recognition of fatty acid compounds. Along the lines of this data mining application, it is suggested that several naming windows of the Sherlock \{MIS\} \{TSBA50\} peak naming method may need to be re-evaluated in order to fit more closely with the bulk of observed fatty acid profiles. At the same time, the global peak occurrence histogram has put forward the delineation of 32 new peak naming windows, accounting for a 26% increase in the total number of fatty acid features taken into account for bacterial identification. By scrutinizing the relationships between the newly delineated naming windows and the many taxonomic units covered within a proprietary fatty acid database, all new naming windows were proven to correspond with stable features of some specific groups of microorganisms. This latter analysis clearly underscores the impact of incorporating the new fatty acid compounds for improving the resolution of the bacterial identification system and endorses the applicability of knowledge discovery in databases within the field of microbiology. }

In this article, we test three typical Humanities research problems: in the first, a researcher wants to find text passages that exhibit similarities to a collection of influential non literary texts from a single author (here, Darwin); in the second, a researcher wants to discover literary passages related to a well understood corpus of literary texts (here, emblematic texts from the Modern Breakthrough); and in the third, a researcher hopes to understand the influence that a particular domain (here, folklore) has had on the realm of literature over a series of decades. We explore these research challenges with three experiments. }

What we produce as data affords as access to different application, benefits, services, delivery etc… In today's world communication is mainly through social networking sites like, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. Huge amount of data that is being generated and shared across these micro-blogging sites, serves as a good source of Big Data Streams for analysis. As the topic of discussion changes drastically, the relevance of data is temporal, which leads to concept-drift. Identification and handling of this concept-drift in such Big Data Streams is present area of interest. The state-of-the-art techniques for identifying trending topics in such data streams mainly concentrates on the frequency of the topic as the key parameter. Concentrating on such a weak indicator, reduces the precision of mining. This study puts forward a novel approach towards identifying concept-drift by initially grouping topics into classes and assigning weight-age for each class, using sliding window processing model upon Twitter streams. }

On a country level, clusters were identified and characterized by patterns of proposal production per inhabitant, score and international cooperation. Belgium and Sweden constitute a cluster characterized by high proposal production, with very high scores and extensive international collaboration. Belgium also excels from another cluster analysis, being as the only country where 100% of proposals involve industry–academia cooperation and obtain scores above 10. Other findings show that single partner proposals have significantly lower quality than multi-partner proposals but, on the other hand, the number of countries involved shows no influence on the quality of the proposals. Despite the high number of industrial participants present on the proposals, it is observed that they play secondary roles in the proposals, with a very low number projects leaded by companies. Also, it is observed that partnerships between research institutions (non-universities) are the most successful. Concerning topics of the proposals, the technology human–robot interface and the product vision robot for small-scale manufacturing are the most significant. Finally, the paper shows clusters of institutions extracted from the giant network of relations obtained from the \{ECHORD\} set of proposals. }

Previously proposed methods are mainly contributed to handling a single constraint and only consider the constraints which are characterized by a single attribute value. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine association rules with multiple constraints constructed by multi-dimensional attribute values. Our proposed approach basically consists of three phases. First, we collect the frequent items and prune infrequent items according to the Apriori property. Second, we exploit the properties of the given constraints to prune search space or save constraint checking in the conditional databases. Third, for each itemset possible to satisfy the constraint, we generate its conditional database and perform the three phases in the conditional database recursively. Our proposed algorithms can exploit the properties of constraints to prune search space or save constraint checking. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is more efficient than the revised FP-growth and \{FIC\} algorithms. }

Automatic tools for assisting patent engineers or decision makers in patent analysis are in great demand. This paper describes a series of text mining techniques that conforms to the analytical process used by patent analysts. These techniques include text segmentation, summary extraction, feature selection, term association, cluster generation, topic identification, and information mapping. The issues of efficiency and effectiveness are considered in the design of these techniques. Some important features of the proposed methodology include a rigorous approach to verify the usefulness of segment extracts as the document surrogates, a corpus- and dictionary-free algorithm for keyphrase extraction, an efficient co-word analysis method that can be applied to large volume of patents, and an automatic procedure to create generic cluster titles for ease of result interpretation. Evaluation of these techniques was conducted. The results confirm that the machine-generated summaries do preserve more important content words than some other sections for classification. To demonstrate the feasibility, the proposed methodology was applied to a real-world patent set for domain analysis and mapping, which shows that our approach is more effective than existing classification systems. The attempt in this paper to automate the whole process not only helps create final patent maps for topic analyses, but also facilitates or improves other patent analysis tasks such as patent classification, organization, knowledge sharing, and prior art searches. }

If these users’ preferences can be tracked, we can show more relevant information following a user’s interests. In this paper, we propose the Topic-Driven SocialRank algorithm to show interest-driven search results with relevant Web content from friends using social contacts online by identifying similar, credible users. Our assumption is that credible users issue more relevant information. We observe that a user has certain common interest with her similar friends in the SN, and focus on identifying similar users who have high credibility and sharing their search experiences. Experimental validation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline method. Our method is potentially effective to find more relevant search results by implicit help of familiar, credible users. }

Tétralogie consists of several agents that communicate with each other on users’ demands in order to deliver results to them. Metadata and document content are extracted before being mined. Results are displayed in the form of histograms, networks and geographical maps; these complementary types of presentations increase the possibilities of analysis compared to the use of these tools separately. We illustrate the overall process through a case study of scientific literature analysis and show how the different agents can be combined to discover the structure of a domain.

In those cases where the control flow between activities cannot be modeled in advance but simply occurs during enactment time (run time), we speak of ad-hoc processes. Ad-hoc processes allow for the flexibility needed in real-life business processes. Since ad-hoc processes are highly dynamic, they represent one of the most difficult challenges, both, technically and conceptually. Caramba is one of the few process-aware collaboration systems allowing for ad-hoc processes. Unlike in classical workflow systems, the users are no longer restricted by the system. Therefore, it is interesting to study the actual way people and organizations work. In this paper, we propose process mining techniques and tools to analyze ad-hoc processes. We introduce process mining, discuss the concept of mining in the context of ad-hoc processes, and demonstrate a concrete application of the concept using Caramba, process mining tools such as \{EMiT\} and MinSoN, and a newly developed extraction tool named Teamlog. }

In natural-language applications it automatically finds groups of related words (called “latent topics”) and clusters the documents into sets that are about the same “topic”. \{LDA\} has also been applied to source code, where the documents are natural source code units such as methods or classes, and the words are the keywords, operators, and programmer-defined names in the code. The problem of determining a topic count that most appropriately describes a set of source code documents is an open problem. We address this empirically by constructing clusterings with different numbers of topics for a large number of software systems, and then use a pair of measures based on source code locality and topic model similarity to assess how well the topic structure identifies related source code units. Results suggest that the topic count required can be closely approximated using the number of software code fragments in the system. We extend these results to recommend appropriate topic counts for arbitrary software systems based on an analysis of a set of open source systems. }

  abstract = {Abstract The goal of supervised classification is to assign a new object to a class from a given set of classes based on the attribute values of this object and on a training set. Although “supervised,” classification algorithms provide only very limited forms of guidance by the user. Typically, the user selects the dataset and sets the values for some parameters of the algorithm, which are often difficult to determine a priori. We believe the user should be involved more interactively in the process of classification because, by providing adequate data and knowledge visualizations, the pattern recognition capabilities of the human can be used to increase the effectivity of classifier construction. Moreover, users often want to validate and explore the classifier model and its output. To address these issues, the classification system should have an intuitive and interactive explanation capability. We present a two-dimensional visualization tool for Bayesian classifiers that can help the user understand why a classifier makes the predictions it does given the vector of parameters in input. The user can interact with the classifier by: selecting different models and changing the parameters of the prior. To help people discover (sub)optimal parameters, we develop a visual interaction method that allows objects to be interactively analyzed. Finally, we present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in text classification. }

  abstract = {Abstract Twitter has become one of the most popular micro-blogging platform recently. Millions of users can share their thoughts and opinions about different aspects and events on the micro-blogging platform. Therefore, Twitter is considered as a rich source of information for decision making and sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive and negative feelings with the aim of identifying attitude and opinions that are expressed in any form or language. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics' feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc. A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classifiers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results. The primary issues in previous techniques are classification accuracy, data sparsity and sarcasm, as they incorrectly classify most of the tweets with a very high percentage of tweets incorrectly classified as neutral. This research paper focuses on these problems and presents an algorithm for twitter feeds classification based on a hybrid approach. The proposed method includes various pre-processing steps before feeding the text to the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed technique overcomes the previous limitations and achieves higher accuracy when compared to similar techniques. }

  abstract = {Abstract The problem of identifying important online or real life events from large textual document streams that are freely available on the World Wide Web is increasingly gaining popularity, given the flourishing of the social web. An event triggers discussion and comments on the WWW, especially in the blogosphere and in microblogging services. Consequently, one should be able to identify the involved entities, topics, time, and location of events through the analysis of information publicly available on the web, create semantically rich representations of events, and then use this information to provide interesting results, or summarize news to users. In this paper, we define the concept of important event and propose an efficient methodology for performing event detection from large time-stamped web document streams. The methodology successfully integrates named entity recognition, dynamic topic map discovery, topic clustering, and peak detection techniques. In addition, we propose an efficient algorithm for detecting all important events from a document stream. We perform extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology and algorithm on a dataset of 7&#xa0;million blogposts, as well as through an international social event detection challenge. The results provide evidence that our approach: a) accurately detects important events, b) creates semantically rich representations of the detected events, c) can be adequately parameterized to correspond to different social perceptions of the event concept, and d) is suitable for online event detection on very large datasets. The expected complexity of the online facet of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of documents in the data stream. }

  abstract = {Data mining is the process of extracting desirable knowledge or interesting patterns from existing databases for specific purposes. Most of the previous approaches set a single minimum support threshold for all the items or itemsets. But in real applications, different items may have different criteria to judge its importance. The support requirements should then vary with different items. In this paper, we provide another point of view about defining the minimum supports of itemsets when items have different minimum supports. The maximum constraint is used, which is well explained and may be suitable to some mining domains. We then propose a simple algorithm based on the Apriori approach to find the large-itemsets and association rules under this constraint. The proposed algorithm is easy and efficient when compared to Wang et al.’s under the maximum constraint. The numbers of association rules and large itemsets obtained by the proposed mining algorithm using the maximum constraint are also less than those using the minimum constraint. Whether to adopt the proposed approach thus depends on the requirements of mining problems. Besides, the granular computing technique of bit strings is used to speed up the proposed data mining algorithm. }

In addition, a keypage-based search mechanism is used to find related papers for protein–protein interactions from a given document.

Although detection methods based on key word list are superior in achieving faster detection and lower memory consumption, they fail to detect text content that is objectionable in semantic description. A framework that can perfectly integrate semantic model and detection method is proposed to perform probability inference for detecting this kind of Web text content. Based on the observation that an objectionable scene could be described by a set of sentences, a topic model which is learnt from the set is employed to act as a semantic model of the objectionable scene. For a given sentence, probability value which shows the likelihood of the sentence with respect to the model is calculated in the framework. Then we use a mapping function to transform the probability value into a new indicator which is convenient for making final decision. Extensive comparison experiments on two real world text sets show that the framework can effectively recognize semantic objectionable text, and both the detection rate and the false alarm rate are superior to those of traditional methods. }

  abstract = {Businesses and people often organize their information of interest (IOI) into a hierarchy of folders (or categories). The personalized folder hierarchy provides a natural way for each of the users to manage and utilize his/her \{IOI\} (a folder corresponds to an interest type). Since the interest is relatively long-term, continuous web scanning is essential. It should be directed by precise and comprehensible specifications of the interest. A precise specification may direct the scanner to those spaces that deserve scanning, while a specification comprehensible to the user may facilitate manual refinement, and a specification comprehensible to information providers (e.g. Internet search engines) may facilitate the identification of proper seed sites to start scanning. However, expressing such specifications is quite difficult (and even implausible) for the user, since each interest type is often implicitly and collectively defined by the content (i.e. documents) of the corresponding folder, which may even evolve over time. In this paper, we present an incremental text mining technique to efficiently identify the user's current interest by mining the user's information folders. The specification mined for each interest type specifies the context of the interest type in conjunctive normal form, which is comprehensible to general users and information providers. The specification is also shown to be more precise in directing the scanner to those sites that are more likely to provide IOI. The user may thus maintain his/her folders and then constantly get IOI, without paying much attention to the difficult tasks of interest specification and seed identification. }

  abstract = {Abstract \{IT\} vendors routinely use social media such as YouTube not only to disseminate their \{IT\} product information, but also to acquire customer input efficiently as part of their market research strategies. Customer responses that appear in social media, however, are typically unstructured; thus, a fairly large data set is needed for meaningful analysis. Although identifying customers’ value structures and attitudes may be useful for developing targeted or niche markets, the unstructured and volume-heavy nature of customer data prohibits efficient and economical extraction of such information. Automatic extraction of customer information would be valuable in determining value structure and strength. This paper proposes an intelligent method of estimating causality between user profiles, value structures, and attitudes based on the replies and published content managed by open social network systems such as YouTube. To show the feasibility of the idea proposed in this paper, information richness and agility are used as underlying concepts to create performance measures based on media/information richness theory. The resulting deep sentiment analysis proves to be superior to legacy sentiment analysis tools for estimation of causality among the focal parameters. }

The objective of the proposed study is to explore the performance of credit scoring using two commonly discussed data mining techniques—classification and regression tree (CART) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). To demonstrate the effectiveness of credit scoring using \{CART\} and MARS, credit scoring tasks are performed on one bank credit card data set. As the results reveal, \{CART\} and \{MARS\} outperform traditional discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM) approaches in terms of credit scoring accuracy and hence provide efficient alternatives in implementing credit scoring tasks. }

A continuous flow of georeferenced events is established to populate and update the geodatabase automatically and in near-real time. We tested the procedure for 2 years at a national scale, creating a geodatabase containing more than 20,000 news items concerning geohazards that occurred in Italy. This procedure enables continuous feedback from events in the real world, such that information about geohazards can be fully exploited rapidly (compared to traditional techniques based on remote sensing, field surveys and historical inventories). }

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method employing text mining techniques to analyze e-mails collected at a customer center. The method uses two kinds of domain-dependent knowledge. One is a key concept dictionary manually provided by human experts. The other is a concept relation dictionary automatically acquired by a fuzzy inductive learning algorithm. The method inputs the subject and the body of an e-mail and decides a text class for the e-mail. Also, the method extracts key concepts from e-mails and presents their statistical information. This paper applies the method to three kinds of analysis tasks: a product analysis task, a contents analysis task, and an address analysis task. The results of numerical experiments indicate that acquired concept relation dictionaries correspond to the intuition of operators in the customer center and give highly precise ratios in the classification. }

Most users typically express their information need via short queries to search engines and they often have to physically sift through the search results based on relevance ranking set by the search engines, making the process of relevance judgement time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a novel representation technique which makes use of the Web structure together with summarisation techniques to better represent knowledge in actual Web Documents. We named the proposed technique as Semantic Virtual Document (SVD). We will discuss how the proposed \{SVD\} can be used together with a suitable clustering algorithm to achieve an automatic content-based categorization of similar Web Documents. The auto-categorization facility as well as a “Tree-like” Graphical User Interface (GUI) for post-retrieval document browsing enhances the relevance judgement process for Internet users. Furthermore, we will introduce how our cluster-biased automatic query expansion technique can be used to overcome the ambiguity of short queries typically given by users. We will outline our experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed \{SVD\} for representation and present a prototype called iSEARCH (Intelligent \{SEarch\} And Review of Cluster Hierarchy) for Web content mining. Our results confirm, quantify and extend previous research using Web structure and summarisation techniques, introducing novel techniques for knowledge representation to enhance Web content mining. }

Based on the user interests, advertisers can significantly reduce their advertising cost by delivering the most relevant ads for the user. The state-of-the-art user Behavior Targeting (BT) models treat user behaviors as documents, and thus use topic models to extract their interests. A limitation of these methods is that user behaviors are usually described as unexplainable hidden topics, which cannot be directly used to guide online advertising. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic User Interest Distribution Mining (UIDM for short) Framework to extract explainable user interests from big user behavior data. In the solution, we first use the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to discover the relationship between users and their behaviors, which can be described as hidden topics. Then, we construct a mapping matrix between the hidden topics and user interests by manually labeling a feature entity matrix. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. }

Most of conventional data mining algorithms identify the relation among transactions with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real world applications. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm based on the Apriori approach to explore interesting knowledge from the transactions with quantitative values. This paper proposes another new fuzzy mining algorithm based on the AprioriTid approach to find fuzzy association rules from given quantitative transactions. Each item uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes, thus making the number of fuzzy regions to be processed the same as that of the original items. The algorithm therefore focuses on the most important linguistic terms for reduced time complexity. Experimental results from the data in a supermarket of a department store show the feasibility of the proposed mining algorithm. }

An important technique for extracting useful information, such as regularities, from usually historical data, is called as association rule mining. Most research on data mining is concentrated on traditional relational data model. On the other hand, the query flocks technique, which extends the concept of association rule mining with a ‘generate-and-test’ model for different kind of patterns, can also be applied to deductive databases. In this paper, query flocks technique is extended with view definitions including recursive views. Although in our system query flock technique can be applied to a data base schema including both the intensional data base (IDB) or rules and the extensible data base (EDB) or tabled relations, we have designed an architecture to compile query flocks from datalog into \{SQL\} in order to be able to use commercially available data base management systems (DBMS) as an underlying engine of our system. However, since recursive datalog views (IDB's) cannot be converted directly into \{SQL\} statements, they are materialized before the final compilation operation. On this architecture, optimizations suitable for the extended query flocks are also introduced. Using the prototype system, which is developed on a commercial database environment, advantages of the new architecture together with the optimizations, are also presented. }

In the paper, we propose an abstract Web mining model for extracting approximate concepts hidden in user profiles on the semantic Web. The abstract Web mining model represents knowledge on user profiles by using an ontology which consists of both ‘part-of’ and ‘is-a’ relations. We also describe the details of using the abstract Web mining model for information gathering. In this application, classes of the ontology are represented as subsets of a list of keywords. An efficient filtering algorithm is also developed to filter out most non-relevant inputs. }

  abstract = {The research on automatic hypertext construction emerges rapidly in the last decade because there exists a urgent need to translate the gigantic amount of legacy documents into web pages. Unlike traditional ‘flat’ texts, a hypertext contains a number of navigational hyperlinks that point to some related hypertexts or locations of the same hypertext. Traditionally, these hyperlinks were constructed by the creators of the web pages with or without the help of some authoring tools. However, the gigantic amount of documents produced each day prevent from such manual construction. Thus an automatic hypertext construction method is necessary for content providers to efficiently produce adequate information that can be used by web surfers. Although most of the web pages contain a number of non-textual data such as images, sounds, and video clips, text data still contribute the major part of information about the pages. Therefore, it is not surprising that most of automatic hypertext construction methods inherit from traditional information retrieval research. In this work, we will propose a new automatic hypertext construction method based on a text mining approach. Our method applies the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster some at text documents in a training corpus and generate two maps. We then use these maps to identify the sources and destinations of some important hyperlinks within these training documents. The constructed hyperlinks are then inserted into the training documents to translate them into hypertext form. Such translated documents will form the new corpus. Incoming documents can also be translated into hypertext form and added to the corpus through the same approach. Our method had been tested on a set of at text documents collected from a newswire site. Although we only use Chinese text documents, our approach can be applied to any documents that can be transformed to a set of index terms. }

We aim to select useful messages by detecting the presence of conversation as an indicator of coordinated citizen action. Using simple linguistic indicators drawn from conversation analysis in social science, we model the presence of coordination in the communication landscape of Twitter1 Popular Microblogging Service: http://www.twitter.com. 1 using a corpus of 1.5 million tweets for various disaster and non-disaster events spanning different periods, lengths of time, and varied social significance. Within replies, retweets and tweets that mention other Twitter users, we found that domain-independent, linguistic cues distinguish likely conversation from non-conversation in this online form of mediated communication. We demonstrate that these likely conversation subsets potentially contain more information than non-conversation subsets, whether or not the tweets are replies, retweets, or mention other Twitter users, as long as they reflect conversational properties. From a practical perspective, we have developed a model for trimming the candidate tweet corpus to identify a much smaller subset of data for submission to deeper, domain-dependent semantic analyses for the identification of actionable information nuggets for coordinated emergency response. }

The innovative part of the paper presents integrated/hybrid model—machine learning (ML) residuals sequential simulations—MLRSS. The models are based on multilayer perceptron and support vector regression \{ML\} algorithms used for modeling long-range spatial trends and sequential simulations of the residuals. \{ML\} algorithms deliver non-linear solution for the spatial non-stationary problems, which are difficult for geostatistical approach. Geostatistical tools (variography) are used to characterize performance of \{ML\} algorithms, by analyzing quality and quantity of the spatially structured information extracted from data with \{ML\} algorithms. Sequential simulations provide efficient assessment of uncertainty and spatial variability. Case study from the Chernobyl fallouts illustrates the performance of the proposed model. It is shown that probability mapping, provided by the combination of \{ML\} data driven and geostatistical model based approaches, can be efficiently used in decision-making process. }

This study focuses on the mining industry as a case study by which we will identify factors and sub-factors hindering \{GSCM\} implementation. A graph theoretic and matrix approach (GTMA) has been used to quantify the adverse impact of these barriers on \{GSCM\} implementation. An assessment of the inhibiting strength of the barriers will help decision makers rank them and decide a course of action that will make an optimum utilization of available resources during times of resource scarcity. }

  abstract = {This paper uses the findings from two workshops conducted with 77 employees of an underground mining operation in Western Australia in April and May 2011. Risk management requires all managers and employees to identify hazards in their work environments. Managers assume that their employees have sufficient knowledge and skills to successfully identify not only obvious but also emerging hazards. For this study, two workshops were conducted using an action research methodology. In the first workshop, “Hazard Identification” it was found that the range of workplace hazards the staff could identify was extensive by some groups and very limited by others. For example length of experience underground did not predetermine an ability to identify hazards. Some of the longest serving and those in supervisory positions identified few hazards. Most teams identified 8–12 hazards under each of four categories within a typology: obvious, trivial, emerging and hidden hazards. However, the team with the least experience were unable to identify more than four obvious, two trivial, five emerging and three hidden hazards in their work areas. In workshop two, “Managing Workplace Hazards”, the teams showed a range of abilities to complete the task with one team (with an average 12&#xa0;years experience underground) unable to identify any strategies to control the list of emerging hazards and one team of managers displaying limited skills. Given these results there is a need to provide further training for all managers and employees in hazard identification and management. }

This paper presents a novel concept called Mediapedia, a dynamic multimedia encyclopedia that takes advantage of, and in fact is built from the text and image resources on the Web. The Mediapedia distinguishes itself from the traditional encyclopedia in four main ways. (1) It tries to present users with multimedia contents (e.g., text, image, video) which we believed are more intuitive and informative to users. (2) It is fully automated because it downloads the media contents as well as the corresponding textual descriptions from the Web and assembles them for presentation. (3) It is dynamic as it will use the latest multimedia content to compose the answer. This is not true for the traditional encyclopedia. (4) The design of Mediapedia is flexible and extensible such that we can easily incorporate new kinds of mediums such as video and languages into the framework. The effectiveness of Mediapedia is demonstrated and two potential applications are described in this paper. }

  abstract = {Abstract Biomedical time series clustering that groups a set of unlabelled temporal signals according to their underlying similarity is very useful for biomedical records management and analysis such as biosignals archiving and diagnosis. In this paper, a new framework for clustering of long-term biomedical time series such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. Specifically, local segments extracted from the time series are projected as a combination of a small number of basis elements in a trained dictionary by non-negative sparse coding. A Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation is then constructed by summing up all the sparse coefficients of local segments in a time series. Based on the BoW representation, a probabilistic topic model that was originally developed for text document analysis is extended to discover the underlying similarity of a collection of time series. The underlying similarity of biomedical time series is well captured attributing to the statistic nature of the probabilistic topic model. Experiments on three datasets constructed from publicly available \{EEG\} and \{ECG\} signals demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods, and is insensitive to model parameters such as length of local segments and dictionary size. }

  abstract = {Based on the hypothesis that the brain is a society of semiautonomous neural agents and full autonomy is the result of coordination of semiautonomous functionalities, a multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach is presented for brain modeling and illustrated with robot motion control. An algorithm named Neighbor-Miner is proposed for \{MADWH\} and MADM. The algorithm is defined in an evolving dynamic environment with semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents. Instead of mining frequent itemsets from customer transactions, the new algorithm discovers new neurofuzzy agents and mines agent associations in first-order logic for coordination that was once considered impossible in traditional data mining. While the Apriori algorithm uses frequency as a priori threshold, Neighbor-Miner uses agent similarity as a priori knowledge. The concept of agent similarity leads to the notions of agent cuboid, orthogonal MADWH, and MADM. Based on agent similarities and action similarities, Neighbor-Miner is presented and illustrated with brain modeling for robot control. The novelty of a multiagent data warehouse lies in its ability to systematically combine neurofuzzy systems, multiagent systems, database systems, machine learning, data mining, information theory, neuroscience, decision, cognition, and control all together into a modern multidimensional information system architecture that is ideal for brain modeling of different animal species with manageable complexity. Although examples in robot control are used to illustrate the basic ideas, the new approach is generally suitable for data mining tasks where knowledge can be discovered collectively by a set of similar semiautonomous or autonomous agents from a geographically, geometrically, or timely distributed environment, especially in high-dimensional scientific and engineering data environments. }

The stratification reduces the size of domain where the selection is applied while the evolutionary method selects the most representative instances. The performance of the proposal is compared with seven non-evolutionary algorithms, in stratified execution. The analysis follows two evaluating approaches: balance between reduction and accuracy of the subsets selected, and balance between interpretability and accuracy of the representation models associated to these subsets. The algorithms have been assessed on large and huge size data sets. The study shows that the stratified evolutionary instance selection consistently outperforms the non-evolutionary ones. The main advantages are: high instance reduction rates, high classification accuracy and models with high interpretability. }

As \{PIR\} focuses its effort on the curation of the UniProt protein sequence database, the goal of iProLINK is to provide curated data sources that can be utilized for text mining research in the areas of bibliography mapping, annotation extraction, protein named entity recognition, and protein ontology development. The data sources for bibliography mapping and annotation extraction include mapped citations (PubMed \{ID\} to protein entry and feature line mapping) and annotation-tagged literature corpora. The latter includes several hundred abstracts and full-text articles tagged with experimentally validated post-translational modifications (PTMs) annotated in the \{PIR\} protein sequence database. The data sources for entity recognition and ontology development include a protein name dictionary, word token dictionaries, protein name-tagged literature corpora along with tagging guidelines, as well as a protein ontology based on \{PIRSF\} protein family names. iProLINK is freely accessible at http://pir.georgetown.edu/iprolink, with hypertext links for all downloadable files. }

CarrotAge has been developed for studying the cropping patterns of a territory. It uses therefore an agricultural drench database, named Ter-Uti , which records every year the land-use category of a set of sites regularly spaced. The results of CarrotAge are interpreted by agronomists and used in research works linking agricultural land use and water management. Moreover, CarrotAge can be used to find out and study crop sequences in large territories, that is a main question for agricultural and environmental research, as discussed in this paper. }

In this paper, we study the problem of discovering frequently occurring structures in semistructured objects using the notion of association rules. We identify that discovering the frequent structures in the early phases of the mining procedure is the dominant cost and we provide a fast algorithm addressing this issue. We present experimental results, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and also its efficiency in reducing dramatically the processing cost. }

Malignant brain neoplasms are among the most devastating and incurable forms of cancer, and their treatment may be excessively complex and costly. Public health decision makers require significant amounts of analytical information to manage public treatment programs for these patients. Data mining, a technology that is used to produce analytically useful information, has been employed successfully with medical data. However, the large-scale adoption of this technique has been limited thus far because it is difficult to use, especially for non-expert users. One way to facilitate data mining by non-expert users is to automate the process. Our aim is to present an automated data mining system that allows public health decision makers to access analytical information regarding brain tumors. The emphasis in this study is the use of ontology in an automated data mining process. The non-experts who tried the system obtained useful information about the treatment of brain tumors. These results suggest that future work should be conducted in this area. }

In the era of Big Data, this problem becomes much more dramatic, since users may be literally overwhelmed by the cataract of data accessible in the most varied forms. With context-aware data tailoring, given a target application, in each specific context the system allows the user to access only the view which is relevant for that application in that context. Moreover, the relative importance of information to the same user in a different context or, reciprocally, to a different user in the same context, may vary enormously; for this reason, contextual preferences can be used to further refine the views associated with contexts, by imposing a ranking on the data of each context-aware view. In this paper, we propose a methodology and a system, \{PREMINE\} (PREference MINEr), where data mining is adopted to infer contextual preferences from the past interaction of the user with contextual views over a relational database, gathering knowledge in terms of association rules between each context and the relevant data. }

In the second phase, mobility rules are extracted from these patterns, and in the last phase, mobility predictions are accomplished by using these rules. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation as compared to two other prediction methods. The performance results obtained in terms of Precision and Recall indicate that our method can make more accurate predictions than the other methods. }

In this paper, we evaluate automatic categorization into more than 80 categories describing the imaging modality and direction as well as the body part and biological system examined. Based on 6231 reference images from hospital routine, 85.5% correctness is obtained combining global texture features with scaled images. With a frequency of 97.7%, the correct class is within the best ten matches, which is sufficient for medical \{CBIR\} applications. }

However, the resulting association patterns did not perform well in prediction of future browsing patterns due to the low matching rate of the resulting rules and users' browsing behavior. This research proposes a new personalized recommendation method integrating user clustering and association-mining techniques. Historical navigation sessions for each user are divided into frames of sessions based on a specific time interval. This research proposes a new clustering method, called \{HBM\} (Hierarchical Bisecting Medoids Algorithm) to cluster users based on the time-framed navigation sessions. Those navigation sessions of the same group are analyzed using the association-mining method to establish a recommendation model for similar students in the future. Finally, an application of this recommendation method to an e-learning web site is presented, including plans of recommendation policies and proposal of new efficiency measures. The effectiveness of the recommendation methods, with and without time-framed user clustering, are investigated and compared. The results showed that the recommendation model built with user clustering by time-framed navigation sessions improves the recommendation services effectively. }

Software processes are dynamic and highly people-dependent. The performance of software processes relies not only on the process itself, but also on the personnel’s capabilities. Therefore, management of human resources and evaluation of a company’s work force capabilities are crucial and will affect software process trustworthiness. Our software process modeling method OEC-SPM (Organization-Entity Capability based Software Process Modeling) has been shown to take into account personnel’s capabilities and groups software developers with certain capabilities into a Process-Agent, which is a way of organizing human resources and process asset libraries in software organizations, and will help to improve trustworthiness of software processes. This paper proposes a novel method for incrementally mining Process-Agents from process asset libraries to support OEC-SPM. The method can automatically and incrementally create Process-Agents under three scenarios with high efficiency. Furthermore, we assess the method with the data from real industry setting. The results show that the utilization of human resources in an organization can be optimized when personnel’s capabilities are taken into account. Additionally, reasonable resource scheduling making use of Process-Agents will result in higher trustworthiness. }

Authorship analysis is the statistical study of linguistic and computational characteristics of the written documents of individuals. This paper is the first work that presents a unified data mining solution to address authorship analysis problems based on the concept of frequent pattern-based writeprint. Extensive experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed solution can precisely capture the writing styles of individuals. Furthermore, the writeprint is effective to identify the author of an anonymous text from a group of suspects and to infer sociolinguistic characteristics of the author. }

It is possible that unique serum proteomic patterns could be used to discriminate cancer samples from non-cancer ones. Due to the complexity of proteomic profiling, a higher order analysis such as data mining is needed to uncover the differences in complex proteomic patterns. The objectives of this paper are (1) to briefly review the application of data mining techniques in proteomics for cancer detection/diagnosis; (2) to explore a novel analytic method with different feature selection methods; (3) to compare the results obtained on different datasets and that reported by Petricoin et al. in terms of detection performance and selected proteomic patterns. Methods and material: Three serum \{SELDI\} \{MS\} data sets were used in this research to identify serum proteomic patterns that distinguish the serum of ovarian cancer cases from non-cancer controls. A support vector machine-based method is applied in this study, in which statistical testing and genetic algorithm-based methods are used for feature selection respectively. Leave-one-out cross validation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used for evaluation and comparison of cancer detection performance. Results and conclusions: The results showed that (1) data mining techniques can be successfully applied to ovarian cancer detection with a reasonably high performance; (2) the classification using features selected by the genetic algorithm consistently outperformed those selected by statistical testing in terms of accuracy and robustness; (3) the discriminatory features (proteomic patterns) can be very different from one selection method to another. In other words, the pattern selection and its classification efficiency are highly classifier dependent. Therefore, when using data mining techniques, the discrimination of cancer from normal does not depend solely upon the identity and origination of cancer-related proteins. }

A key role in the analysis of textual \{UGC\} is played by topics, meant as specific concepts of interest within a subject area. To enable aggregations of topics at different levels, a topic hierarchy has to be defined. Some attempts have been made to address the peculiarities of topic hierarchies, but no comprehensive solution has been found so far. The approach we propose to model topic hierarchies in \{ROLAP\} systems is called meta-stars. Its basic idea is to use meta-modeling coupled with navigation tables and with dimension tables: navigation tables support hierarchy instances with different lengths and with non-leaf facts, and allow different roll-up semantics to be explicitly annotated; meta-modeling enables hierarchy heterogeneity and dynamics to be accommodated; dimension tables are easily integrated with standard business hierarchies. After outlining a reference architecture for social business intelligence and describing the meta-star approach, we formalize its querying expressiveness and give a cost model for the main query execution plans. Then, we evaluate meta-stars by presenting experimental results for query performances and disk space. }

A Bayesian network is a graphical knowledge representation tool. However, learning Bayesian networks from data is a difficult problem. There are two different approaches to the network learning problem. The first one uses dependency analysis, while the second approach searches good network structures according to a metric. Unfortunately, the two approaches both have their own drawbacks. Thus, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the characteristics of these approaches to improve learning effectiveness and efficiency. The new learning algorithm consists of the conditional independence (CI) test and the search phases. In the \{CI\} test phase, dependency analysis is conducted to reduce the size of the search space. In the search phase, good Bayesian networks are generated by a cooperative coevolution genetic algorithm (GA). We conduct a number of experiments and compare the new algorithm with our previous algorithm, Minimum Description Length and Evolutionary Programming (MDLEP), which uses evolutionary programming (EP) for network learning. The results illustrate that the new algorithm has better performance. We apply the algorithm to a large real-world data set and compare the performance of the discovered Bayesian networks with that of the back-propagation neural networks and the logistic regression models. This study illustrates that the algorithm is a promising alternative to other data mining algorithms. }

Although hand-crafted heuristics are a common practical approach for extracting information from text, a general, and generalizable, approach requires adaptive techniques. This paper studies the way in which the adaptive techniques used in text compression can be applied to text mining. It develops several examples: extraction of hierarchical phrase structures from text, identification of keyphrases in documents, locating proper names and quantities of interest in a piece of text, text categorization, word segmentation, acronym extraction, and structure recognition. We conclude that compression forms a sound unifying principle that allows many text mining problems to be tacked adaptively. }

Chomsky, 1995), in contrast to the head movement analysis. That is, as far as syntactic process is concerned, Ha- and R-constructions are one and the same construction. Two constructions and their surface variations arise as a result of selective PF-deletion process in the lower copy of the moved constituent. The analysis proposed in this paper provides a uniform analysis of two types of predicate contrastive topic constructions in Korean and also provides a systematic account of both similarities and differences with regard to morpho-syntactic and semantic properties found in two construction types. To the extent the current proposal holds, it provides strong empirical evidence for copy theory of movement and late lexical insertion along the lines of Distributed Morphology (cf. Halle and Marantz, 1993). Furthermore, it constitutes strong empirical evidence for the assumption that verbal inflections as well as verbal roots are independently projected to syntactic structure in Korean. }

Although very effective techniques are currently used by the most popular search engines when no a priori knowledge on the user's desires beside the search keywords is available, in different settings it is conceivable to design search methods that operate on a thematic database of web pages that refer to a common body of knowledge or to specific sets of users. We have considered such premises to design and develop a search method that deploys data mining and optimization techniques to provide a more significant and restricted set of pages as the final result of a user search. We adopt a vectorization method based on search context and user profile to apply clustering techniques that are then refined by a specially designed genetic algorithm. In this paper we describe the method, its implementation, the algorithms applied, and discuss some experiments that has been run on test sets of web pages. }

Visual data captured from the user's environment, using overhead cameras along with motion data, which are collected from accelerometers on the subject's body, can be fed to activity detection systems that can detect emergency situations like falls and injuries. The output of these sensors is data streams that require real time recognition, especially in such emergency situations. In this paper, we study motion and activity related streaming data and we propose classification schemes using traditional classification approaches. However, such approaches may not be always applicable for immediate alarm triggering and fall prevention or when \{CPU\} power and memory resources are limited (e.g.&#xa0;running the detection algorithm on a mobile device such as smartphones). To this end, we also propose a statistical mining methodology that may be used for real time motion data processing. The paper includes details of the stream data analysis methodology incorporated in the activity recognition and fall detection system along with an initial evaluation of the achieved accuracy in detecting falls. The results are promising and indicate that using the proposed methodology real time fall detection is feasible. }

Tremendous amount of knowledge are recorded using various types of media, producing enormous amount of web pages in the WWW. Retrieval of required information from the \{WWW\} is thus an arduous task. Different schemes for retrieving web pages have been used by the \{WWW\} community. One of the most widely used scheme is to traverse predefined web directories to reach a user's goal. These web directories are compiled or classified folders of web pages and are usually organized into hierarchical structures. The classification of web pages into proper directories and the organization of directory hierarchies are generally performed by human experts. In this work, we provide a corpus-based method that applies a kind of text mining techniques on a corpus of web pages to automatically create web directories and organize them into hierarchies. The method is based on the self-organizing map learning algorithm and requires no human intervention during the construction of web directories and hierarchies. The experiments show that our method can produce comprehensible and reasonable web directories and hierarchies. }

To support the design of workflows, we propose the use of workflow mining. Starting point for workflow mining is a so-called “workflow log” containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed.

The distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of unstructured information can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an identity for their product or brand in the minds of their customers. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. Existing approaches to opinion mining, in fact, are still far from being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language as they mainly rely on knowledge bases that are too limited to efficiently process text at concept-level. In this context, standard clustering techniques have been previously employed on an affective common-sense knowledge base in attempt to discover how different natural language concepts are semantically and affectively related to each other and, hence, to accordingly mine on-line opinions. In this work, a novel cognitive model based on the combined use of multi-dimensional scaling and artificial neural networks is exploited for better modelling the way multi-word expressions are organised in a brain-like universe of natural language concepts. The integration of a biologically inspired paradigm with standard principal component analysis helps to better grasp the non-linearities of the resulting vector space and, hence, improve the affective common-sense reasoning capabilities of the system. }

In this paper, we consider workloads that consist of mixtures of \{OLTP\} transactions and association rule mining queries. We propose and evaluate a new scheme for memory-adaptive association rule mining. It is designed to be used in the case of memory fluctuations, which are due to \{OLTP\} transactions that run with higher priority. The proposed scheme uses dynamic adjustment to the provided buffer space. Thus, it avoids the drawbacks of simple but naive approaches; namely the thrashing due to large disk accesses that can be caused by the direct use of virtual memory or long delay times due to suspension. Detailed experimental results, which consider a wide range of factors, indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme. }

Most existing learning techniques that extract signal-level contents from video data struggle to scale due to efficiency limits. With the development of pervasive positioning techniques, discovering hot topics from multimedia data by their geographical tags has become practical: videos taken by advanced cameras are associated with \{GPS\} locations, and geo-tagged videos from YouTube can be identified by their associated \{GPS\} locations on Google Maps. It enables us to know the cultures, scenes, and human behaviors from videos based on their spatio-temporal distributions. However, meaningful topic discovery requires an efficient clustering approach, through which coherent topics can be detected according to particular geographical regions without out-of-focus effects. To handle this problem, this paper presents a filter-refinement framework to discover hot topics corresponding to geographical dense regions, and then introduces two novel metrics to refine unbounded hot regions, together with a heuristic method for setting rational thresholds on these metrics. The results of extensive experiments prove that hot topics can be efficiently discovered by our framework, and more compact topics can be achieved after using the novel metrics. }

(2003) proposed a fuzzy data mining method to discover fuzzy sequential patterns. In this method, consumers’ products preferences and consumers’ product buying orders related to purchase behaviors can be found in the fuzzy sequential pattern mining. Since for each decision problem, there is a competence set consisting of ideas, knowledge, information, and skills for solving that problem, we consider knowledge found in fuzzy sequential pattern mining as a needed competence set for solving one decision problem. This paper uses a known competence set expansion method, the minimum spanning table method, to find appropriate two-stage learning sequences that can effectively acquire individual fuzzy knowledge sets found in the fuzzy sequential pattern mining. A numerical example is used to show the usefulness of the proposed method. }

However, given the size and complexity of modern healthcare systems, this practice does not scale easily. The goal of this work is to investigate the extent to which organizational relationships can be automatically learned from utilization patterns of electronic health record (EHR) systems. Method We designed an online survey to solicit the perspectives of employees of a large academic medical center. We surveyed employees from two administrative areas: (1) Coding &amp; Charge Entry and (2) Medical Information Services and two clinical areas: (3) Anesthesiology and (4) Psychiatry. To test our hypotheses we selected two administrative units that have work-related responsibilities with electronic records; however, for the clinical areas we selected two disciplines with very different patient responsibilities and whose accesses and people who accessed were similar. We provided each group of employees with questions regarding the chance of interaction between areas in the medical center in the form of association rules (e.g., Given someone from Coding &amp; Charge Entry accessed a patient's record, what is the chance that someone from Medical Information Services access the same record?). We compared the respondent predictions with the rules learned from actual \{EHR\} utilization using linear-mixed effects regression models. Results The findings from our survey confirm that medical center employees can distinguish between association rules of high and non-high likelihood when their own area is involved. Moreover, they can make such distinctions between for any \{HCO\} area in this survey. It was further observed that, with respect to highly likely interactions, respondents from certain areas were significantly better than other respondents at making such distinctions and certain areas’ associations were more distinguishable than others. Conclusions These results illustrate that \{EHR\} utilization patterns may be consistent with the expectations of \{HCO\} employees. Our findings show that certain areas in the \{HCO\} are easier than others for employees to assess, which suggests that automated learning strategies may yield more accurate models of healthcare organizations than those based on the perspectives of a select few individuals. }

In the e-commerce context, concept extraction can be used to identify what a shopping related Web page is talking about.

We upgrade \{ACE\} into Improved Concept Extractor (ICE) with significant improvements. \{KEA\} is a supervised learning system. We evaluate the methods by comparing automatically generated concepts to a gold standard. The experimental results demonstrate that \{ICE\} significantly outperforms \{ACE\} and also outperforms \{KEA\} in concept extraction. To demonstrate the practical use of concept extraction in the e-commerce context, we use \{ICE\} and \{KEA\} to showcase two e-commerce applications, i.e. product matching and topic-based opinion mining. }

  abstract = {Mining method selection is among the most critical and problematic points in mining engineering profession. Choosing a suitable method for a given ore-body is very important for the economics, safety and the productivity of the mining work. In the past studies there are attempts to build up a systematic approach to help the engineers to make this selection. But, these approaches work based on static databases and fail in inserting the intuitive feelings and engineering judgments of experienced engineers to the selection process. In this study, a system based on 13 different expert systems and one interface agent is developed, to make mining method selection for the given ore-bodies. The agent Ore-Age, to follow his goal of supplying the maximum assistance to engineers in selecting the most suitable method for a specific ore-body, tries to learn the experiences of the experts he has faced. After this learning process the knowledge base is evolved to include these experiences, making the system more efficient and intuitive in mining method selection work. To realize the above goal, the system's tutoring procedure is executed by the agent, in case an inexperienced user enters the system, to complete his/her missing knowledge about mining method selection. }

Such blocks without overlapping of genes can be further merged to form a new chromosome and the quality of the new chromosome can be greatly improved. Based on this concept, we propose a novel block mining method that is able to locate common structures or to establish new blocks (like a small piece of puzzle) from a set of high fit chromosomes. The identified blocks (puzzles) will also be updated generation by generation through the newly updated high fit chromosomes. We develop a heuristic re-combination procedure to form a new chromosome by re-combining the blocks. We call the new chromosomes generated as artificial chromosomes (ACs) and inject them into the evolutionary process when the convergence slope of the evolutionary process is less than a predefined threshold. This new algorithm retains the regular simple genetic algorithm (SGA) operations of crossover and mutation, and utilizes the \{ACs\} generated from elites to speed up the convergence process. Experimental results indicate that the puzzle-based method of chromosome generation is very efficient and effective in solving the traditional permutation flowshop scheduling problem. The new method can be applied to tackle other NP-complete problems such as scheduling and vehicle routing problems. }

The usefulness of such a repository lies in the provision of a base of knowledge, where developers can identify reusable components and researchers can find a mined data set. Currently, 141 open source projects have been considered and more than 4500 pattern instances have been found and recorded in the database of the repository. The evaluation of the repository has been performed from an academic and a practical point of view. The results suggest that the repository can be useful for both experienced and inexperienced users. However, the benefits of using the repository are more significant for inexperienced users. }

Text mining is the combined, automated process of analyzing unstructured, natural language text to discover information and knowledge that are typically difficult to retrieve. Here, we focus on text mining as applied to the biomedical literature. We focus in particular on finding relationships among genes, proteins, drugs and diseases, to facilitate an understanding and prediction of complex biological processes.

Particularly through data mining—the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases—organizations can identify valuable customers, predict future behaviors, and enable firms to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The automated, future-oriented analyses made possible by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events typically provided by history-oriented tools such as decision support systems. Data mining tools answer business questions that in the past were too time-consuming to pursue. Yet, it is the answers to these questions make customer relationship management possible. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each with their own advantages and challenges for different types of applications. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). While differing approaches abound in the realm of data mining, the use of some type of data mining is necessary to accomplish the goals of today’s customer relationship management philosophy. }

Eng. 43(4) (2002) 735), the aim of this paper is to propose a new fuzzy data mining technique consisting of two phases to find fuzzy if–then rules for classification problems: one to find frequent fuzzy grids by using a pre-specified simple fuzzy partition method to divide each quantitative attribute, and the other to generate fuzzy classification rules from frequent fuzzy grids. To improve the classification performance of the proposed method, we specially incorporate adaptive rules proposed by Nozaki et al. (IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst. 4(3) (1996) 238) into our methods to adjust the confidence of each classification rule. For classification generalization ability, the simulation results from the iris data demonstrate that the proposed method may effectively derive fuzzy classification rules from training samples. }

Existing researches mostly focus on the sentiment classification of the product and service reviews in document level. Reviews of social events such as economic and political activities, which are called social reviews, have specific characteristics different to the reviews of products and services. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to automatically discover the aspects discussed in Chinese social reviews and also the sentiments expressed in different aspects. The approach is called Multi-aspect Sentiment Analysis for Chinese Online Social Reviews (MSA-COSRs). We first apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover multi-aspect global topics of social reviews, and then extract the local topic and associated sentiment based on a sliding window context over the review text. The aspect of the local topic is identified by a trained \{LDA\} model, and the polarity of the associated sentiment is classified by HowNet lexicon. The experiment results show that MSA-COSR cannot only obtain good topic partitioning results, but also help to improve sentiment analysis accuracy. It helps to simultaneously discover multi-aspect fine-grained topics and associated sentiment. }

The resulting term network can be used for entity relation visualization and exploration, which is useful in many text-mining applications such as crime exploration and investigation from vast piles of crime news or official criminal records. In the proposed method, terms from each document in a text collection are first identified. They are subjected to an analysis for pairwise association weights. The weights are then accumulated over all the documents to obtain final similarity for each term pair. Based on the resulting term similarity, a general term network for the collection is built with terms as nodes and non-zero similarities as links. In application, a list of predefined terms having similar attributes was selected to extract the desired sub-network from the general term network for entity relation visualization. This text analysis scenario based on the collective terms of the similar type or from the same topic enables evidence-based relation exploration. Some practical instances of crime exploration and investigation are demonstrated. Our application examples show that term relations, be it causality, subordination, coupling, or others, can be effectively revealed by our method and easily verified by the underlying text collection. This work contributes by presenting an integrated term-relationship mining and exploration approach and demonstrating the feasibility of the term network to the increasingly important application of crime exploration and investigation. }

The wealth of textual information contained in publicly available Web sites is converted into aggregated representations through textual analysis. The application of word lists, keyword analysis, term clustering, and correspondence analyses to identify and represent semantic relationships, including their longitudinal patterns, is illustrated through a case study that investigates the global coverage of solar power technologies in international media. The resulting graphs, indicators and tables describe complex relationships and developments that are hard to capture in traditional ways. As such they facilitate investigations about the nature and dynamics of Web content. }

  abstract = {Discovery of sequential patterns is becoming increasingly useful and essential in many scientific and commercial domains. Enormous sizes of available datasets and possibly large number of mined patterns demand efficient, scalable, and parallel algorithms. Even though a number of algorithms have been developed to efficiently parallelize frequent pattern discovery algorithms that are based on the candidate-generation-and-counting framework, the problem of parallelizing the more efficient projection-based algorithms has received relatively little attention and existing parallel formulations have been targeted only toward shared-memory architectures. The irregular and unstructured nature of the task-graph generated by these algorithms and the fact that these tasks operate on overlapping sub-databases makes it challenging to efficiently parallelize these algorithms on scalable distributed-memory parallel computing architectures. In this paper we present and study a variety of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for a tree-projection-based frequent sequence discovery algorithm that are able to minimize the various overheads associated with load imbalance, database overlap, and interprocessor communication. Our experimental evaluation on a 32 processor \{IBM\} \{SP\} show that these algorithms are capable of achieving good speedups, substantially reducing the amount of the required work to find sequential patterns in large databases. }

Although efficient, these systems are neither versatile nor adaptive, since newly discovered customer trends cannot be easily integrated with existing knowledge. Advancing on the way the above mentioned techniques apply on \{ERP\} systems, we have developed a multi-agent system that introduces adaptive intelligence as a powerful add-on for \{ERP\} software customization. The system can be thought of as a recommendation engine, which takes advantage of knowledge gained through the use of data mining techniques, and incorporates it into the resulting company selling policy. The intelligent agents of the system can be periodically retrained as new information is added to the ERP. In this paper, we present the architecture and development details of the system, and demonstrate its application on a real test case. }

The developed model is based on the feature of \{ID3\} algorithm to explore explanatory knowledge via information theory and statistics to derive appropriateness via utilization gain. The main output of the \{DMBA\} is the weights as the basis of library material acquisition budget allocation for departments via the combination of explored explanatory knowledge and appropriateness.

We employed topic discovery to identify top keywords and key themes and implemented the 7-entity model Named Entity Recognition process to identify the key persons, organizations and locations discussed in the blog posts. Thereafter we performed sentiment classification of the entire blog data into positive and negative categories using SentiWordNet. The results obtained are very interesting and validate the usefulness of our approach for computational analysis of social media data. The key contribution of the paper is to propose a novel Text Analytics combine and demonstrate its applicability for computational exploration of the social media data for sociological analysis purposes. }

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the advanced methods of frequent pattern mining, which mines more complex forms of frequent patterns and considers user preferences or constraints to speed up the mining process. Frequent pattern mining has reached far beyond the basics due to substantial research, numerous extensions of the problem scope, and broad application studies. An in-depth coverage of methods for mining many kinds of patterns is included elaborating on: multilevel patterns, multidimensional patterns, patterns in continuous data, rare patterns, negative patterns, constrained frequent patterns, frequent patterns in high-dimensional data, colossal patterns, and compressed and approximate patterns. Other pattern mining themes, including mining sequential and structured patterns and mining patterns from spatiotemporal, multimedia, and stream data, are considered more advanced. Pattern mining is a more general term than frequent pattern mining since the former covers rare and negative patterns as well. However, when there is no ambiguity, the two terms are used interchangeably. In addition to mining for basic frequent itemsets and associations, advanced forms of patterns can be mined such as multilevel associations and multidimensional associations, quantitative association rules, rare patterns, and negative patterns. Users can also mine high-dimensional patterns and compressed or approximate patterns. Frequent pattern mining has many diverse applications, ranging from pattern-based data cleaning to pattern-based classification, clustering, and outlier or exception analysis. }

This paper thus proposes a data mining technique to discover fuzzy classification rules based on the well-known Apriori algorithm. Significantly, since it is difficult for users to specify the minimum fuzzy support used to determine the frequent fuzzy grids or the minimum fuzzy confidence used to determine the effective classification rules derived from frequent fuzzy grids, therefore the genetic algorithms are incorporated into the proposed method to determine those two thresholds with binary chromosomes. For classification generalization ability, the simulation results from the iris data and the appendicitis data demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in comparison with other classification methods. }

Subjectivity relations that exist between the different actors are labeled with information concerning both the identity of the attitude holder and the orientation (positive vs. negative) of the attitude. The model includes a categorization into semantic categories relevant to opinion mining and sentiment analysis and provides means for the identification of the attitude holder and the polarity of the attitude and for the description of the emotions and sentiments of the different actors involved in the text. Special attention is paid to the role of the speaker/writer of the text whose perspective is expressed and whose views on what is happening are conveyed in the text. Finally, validation is provided by an annotation study that shows that these subtle subjectivity relations are reliably identifiable by human annotators. }

As the recent advent of the Internet, most of the modern firms are now geared towards using the web technology in their daily as well as strategic activities. The web-mining technology provides them with unprecedented ability to analyze web-log data, which are seemingly full of useful information, but often lack of important and meaningful information. This indicates the need to develop an advanced inference mechanism extracting richer implication from the web-mining results. In this sense, we propose a new web-mining inference amplification (WEMIA) mechanism using the inference logic of FCM. The association rule mining is what we adopt as the web-mining technique to prove the validity of the proposed WEMIA. The main recipe of the proposed \{WEMIA\} is the three-phased inference amplification. The first phase is to apply the association rule mining, and the second phase is to transform the association rules into FCM-driven causal knowledge bases. The third phase is dedicated to amplifying the inference by developing the causal knowledge-based inference equivalence property, which was derived from analyzing the inference mechanism of FCMs. With an illustrative web-log database, we suggest results proving the robustness of our proposed \{WEMIA\} mechanism. }

  abstract = {Data mining of available biomedical data and information has greatly boosted target discovery in the ‘omics’ era. Target discovery is the key step in the biomarker and drug discovery pipeline to diagnose and fight human diseases. In biomedical science, the ‘target’ is a broad concept ranging from molecular entities (such as genes, proteins and miRNAs) to biological phenomena (such as molecular functions, pathways and phenotypes). Within the context of biomedical science, data mining refers to a bioinformatics approach that combines biological concepts with computer tools or statistical methods that are mainly used to discover, select and prioritize targets. In response to the huge demand of data mining for target discovery in the ‘omics’ era, this review explicates various data mining approaches and their applications to target discovery with emphasis on text and microarray data analysis. Two emerging data mining approaches, chemogenomic data mining and proteomic data mining, are briefly introduced. Also discussed are the limitations of various data mining approaches found in the level of database integration, the quality of data annotation, sample heterogeneity and the performance of analytical and mining tools. Tentative strategies of integrating different data sources for target discovery, such as integrated text mining with high-throughput data analysis and integrated mining with pathway databases, are introduced. }

Difficulties arise from the large variations of human appearance in different poses, and from the different camera views that may be involved, making low-level descriptor representation unreliable. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute-Restricted Latent Topic Model (ARLTM) to encode targets into semantic topics. Compared to conventional topic models such as \{LDA\} and pLSI, \{ARLTM\} performs best by imposing semantic restrictions onto the generation of human specific attributes. We use \{MCMC\} \{EM\} for model learning. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. }

In this paper, we present the Collaborative Spider, a multi-agent system designed to provide post-retrieval analysis and enable across-user collaboration in Web search and mining. This system allows the user to annotate search sessions and share them with other users. We also report a user study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this system. Our experimental findings show that subjects' search performance was degraded, compared to individual search scenarios in which users had no access to previous searches, when they had access to a limited number (e.g., 1 or 2) of earlier search sessions done by other users. However, search performance improved significantly when subjects had access to more search sessions. This indicates that gain from collaboration through collaborative Web searching and analysis does not outweigh the overhead of browsing and comprehending other users' past searches until a certain number of shared sessions have been reached. In this paper, we also catalog and analyze several different types of user collaboration behavior observed in the context of Web mining. }

  abstract = {Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce applications that use data mining techniques to explore datasets in the social media context. However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog’s description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user’s sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact. }

When an attacker knows or guesses a password correctly, the system is compromised. Therefore, this research focuses on this weakness and proposes an additional security token to this scheme by combining keystroke dynamics into the system. A username is typically not changed but a password is required to change frequently for a better security level. A username is typed frequently such that the familiar typing can be used as a behavioral biometrics of a user. Therefore, a keystroke dynamics profile is proposed using a trajectory dissimilarity technique to verify user's typing behavior on a username as an additional authentication token. Several features are mined for keystroke dynamics to create a trajectory profile, which gives the best results of 4% equal error rate (EER) or 96% authentication accuracy. }

We propose to attack this problem using an adaptive population of intelligent agents mining the Web online at query time. We discuss the benefits and shortcomings of using dynamic search strategies versus the traditional static methods in which search and retrieval are disjoint. This paper presents a public Web intelligence tool called MySpiders, a threaded multiagent system designed for information discovery. The performance of the system is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness in locating recent, relevant documents with that of search engines. We present results suggesting that augmenting search engines with adaptive populations of intelligent search agents can lead to a significant competitive advantage. We also discuss some of the challenges of evaluating such a system on current Web data, introduce three novel metrics for this purpose, and outline some of the lessons learned in the process. }

Web Citation Database is a data warehouse used for storing citation indices of Web publications. In this paper, we propose a mining process to automate the \{ACA\} based on the Web Citation Database. The mining process uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) as the mining technique for author clustering and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for displaying author cluster maps. The clustering results and author cluster map have been incorporated into a citation-based retrieval system known as PubSearch to support author retrieval of Web publications. }

Input variables represent extraction parameters and coordinates of the points of interest, while the output variable represents surface subsidence data. After the neural network has been successfully trained, its performance is tested on a separate testing set. Finally, the surface subsidence trough above the projected excavation is predicted by the trained neural network. The applicability of \{ANN\} for the prediction of surface subsidence was verified in different subsidence models and proved on actual excavated levels and in levelled data on surface profile points in the Velenje Coal Mine. }

However, the following three disadvantages prevent them from wider application compared to other machine learning methods: (i) the performance is inferior on small datasets; (ii) the performance will degrade for data with high dimensions; (iii) they are heavily dependent on the chosen feature and distance measure. In this paper, we try to overcome the three mentioned intrinsic weaknesses by taking the abundant and diversified content of social media images into account. Firstly, we propose a novel neighborhood similarity measure which encodes both the local density information and semantic information, thus it has better generalization power than the original image-to-image similarity. Secondly, to enhance the scalability, we adopt kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) to conduct approximated nearest neighbor search by utilizing a set of kernels calculated on several complementary image features. Finally, to enhance the robustness on diversified genres of images, we propose to fuse the discrimination power of different features by combining multiple neighborhood similarities calculated on different features/kernels with the entire retrieved nearest labeled and unlabeled image via the hashing systems. Experimental results on visual categorization on the Caltech-256 and two social media databases show the advantage of our method over traditional \{NN\} methods using the labeled data only. }

Knowledge structures, ranging in formality from ontologies to folksonomies, support user activity by enabling users to categorize and retrieve information resources. In this paper we enhance the search and recommendation functionalities of Enterprise Social Software by extending their knowledge structures with the addition of underlying hidden topics which we discover using probabilistic topic models. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to elicit hidden topics and use the latter to assess similarities in resource and tag recommendation as well as for the expansion of query results. As an application of our approach we have extended the search and recommendation facilities of an open source Enterprise Social Software system which we have deployed and evaluated in five knowledge-intensive small and medium enterprises. }

  abstract = {This paper explores website link structure considering websites as interconnected graphs and analyzing their features as a social network. Two networks have been extracted for representing websites: a domain network containing subdomains or external domains linked through the website and a page network containing webpages browsed from the root domain. Factor analysis provides the statistical methodology to adequately extract the main website profiles in terms of their internal structure. However, due to the large number of indicators, the task of selecting a representative subset of indicators becomes unaffordable. A genetic search of an optimum subset of indicators is proposed in this paper, selecting a multi-objective fitness function based on factor analysis results. The optimum solution provides a coherent and relevant categorization of website profiles, and highlights the possibilities of genetic algorithms as a tool for discovering new knowledge in the field of web mining. }

  abstract = {Abstract One of the most challenging problems in aspect-based opinion mining is aspect extraction, which aims to identify expressions that describe aspects of products (called aspect expressions) and categorize domain-specific synonymous expressions. Although a number of methods of aspect extraction have been proposed before, very few of them are designed to improve the interpretability of generated aspects. Existing methods either generate multiple fine-grained aspects without proper categorization or categorize semantically unrelated product aspects (e.g., by unsupervised topic modeling). In this paper, we first examine previous studies on product aspect extraction. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, two novel semi-supervised models for product aspect extraction are then proposed. More specifically, the proposed methodology first extracts seeding aspects and related terms from detailed product descriptions readily available on E-commerce websites. Next, product reviews are regrouped according to these seeding aspects so that more effective textual contexts for topic modeling are built. Finally, two novel semi-supervised topic models are developed to extract human-comprehensible product aspects. For the first proposed topic model, the Fine-grained Labeled \{LDA\} (FL-LDA), seeding aspects are applied to guide the model to discover words that are related to these seeding aspects. For the second model, the Unified Fine-grained Labeled \{LDA\} (UFL-LDA), we incorporate unlabeled documents to extend the FL-LDA model so that words related to the seeding aspects or other high-frequency words in customer reviews are extracted. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods. }

Some terminologies, such as the \{UMLS\} and \{SNOMED\} are comprehensive, whereas others specialize in limited domains (i.e., BIRADS) or are developed for specific applications. An important feature of a terminology is comprehensive coverage of relevant clinical terms and ease of use by users, which include computerized applications. We have developed a method for facilitating vocabulary development and maintenance that is based on utilization of natural language processing to mine large collections of clinical reports in order to obtain information on terminology as expressed by physicians. Once the reports are processed and the terms structured and collected into an \{XML\} representational schema, it is possible to determine information about terms, such as frequency of occurrence, compositionality, relations to other terms (such as modifiers), and correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. This paper describes the method and discusses how it can be used as a tool to help vocabulary builders navigate through the terms physicians use, visualize their relations to other terms via a flexible viewer, and determine their correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. }

  abstract = {Abstract Molecular biological data has rapidly increased with the recent progress of the Omics fields, e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics that necessitates the development of databases and methods for efficient storage, retrieval, integration and analysis of massive data. The present study reviews the usage of \{KNApSAcK\} Family \{DB\} in metabolomics and related area, discusses several statistical methods for handling multivariate data and shows their application on Indonesian blended herbal medicines (Jamu) as a case study. Exploration using Biplot reveals many plants are rarely utilized while some plants are highly utilized toward specific efficacy. Furthermore, the ingredients of Jamu formulas are modeled using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) in order to predict their efficacy. The plants used in each Jamu medicine served as the predictors, whereas the efficacy of each Jamu provided the responses. This model produces 71.6% correct classification in predicting efficacy. Permutation test then is used to determine plants that serve as main ingredients in Jamu formula by evaluating the significance of the PLS-DA coefficients. Next, in order to explain the role of plants that serve as main ingredients in Jamu medicines, information of pharmacological activity of the plants is added to the predictor block. Then N-PLS-DA model, multiway version of PLS-DA, is utilized to handle the three-dimensional array of the predictor block. The resulting N-PLS-DA model reveals that the effects of some pharmacological activities are specific for certain efficacy and the other activities are diverse toward many efficacies. Mathematical modeling introduced in the present study can be utilized in global analysis of big data targeting to reveal the underlying biology. }

This efficient numerical method simulates the mechanical behavior of nonlinear, large deformation and dynamic problems. Under the assumption of small strain, the motion of points in a deformable block can be decomposed into the sum of the block’s rigid body motion and the deformation of the block. Kinematic equations for deformable blocks are derived. Deformation of blocks can be expressed by a series of deformation modes, which can be decoupled under given orthogonal conditions. The simulation results verify that good accuracy is achievable under the small strain condition using this method, compared with the finite element method. Under the condition of finite deformation, similar results are obtained by the proposed method and a three-dimensional deformable distinct element code, 3DEC. In verification examples, 3MDEM is more efficient than 3DEC. }

This paper proposes a learning algorithm, which can be viewed as a knowledge acquisition tool, to effectively discover fuzzy association rules for classification problems. The consequence part of each rule is one class label. The proposed learning algorithm consists of two phases: one to generate large fuzzy grids from training samples by fuzzy partitioning in each attribute, and the other to generate fuzzy association rules for classification problems by large fuzzy grids. The proposed learning algorithm is implemented by scanning training samples stored in a database only once and applying a sequence of Boolean operations to generate fuzzy grids and fuzzy rules; therefore, it can be easily extended to discover other types of fuzzy association rules. The simulation results from the iris data demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can effectively derive fuzzy association rules for classification problems. }

The turnover trend of technology professionals was examined in well-known Taiwanese companies. The results indicate that the high outstanding turnover trend circle was primarily caused by a lack of inner fidelity identification, leadership and management.

More specifically, the present study focuses on the impact of region, a macro-social variable, and compliment topic, a micro-social factor, on Chinese compliments given by Taiwan Chinese and Mainland Chinese higher education students. Sixty Taiwanese and sixty Mainland Chinese, equally gendered in each group, completed a written discourse completion task consisting of eight content-enriched situations (Billmyer and Varghese, 2000) eliciting compliments. With regard to the impact of region, commonalities emerged between those compliments of Chinese students in Taiwan and Mainland China. Both groups preferred to offer Explicit compliments as well as Implicit compliments in the form of Requests, Assumptions, and Want Statements. Overall, Explicit compliments emerged as the most popular strategy. However, statistically significant differences were identified between the two groups in a few Implicit compliment strategies. Regarding the effect of compliment topic, both Taiwan and Mainland Chinese students utilized several compliment strategies in similar ways across appearance/possession and performance/ability situations. It appears that in most cases, it was compliment topic rather than the variety of Chinese which modulated the compliments by both groups. In addition, the paper suggests that compliments in Taiwan and Mainland Chinese may have undergone a change, possibly influenced by western cultures. }

One characteristic of these Apriori-based algorithms is that candidate itemsets are generated in rounds, with the size of the itemsets incremented by one per round. The number of database scans required by Apriori-based algorithms thus depends on the size of the biggest frequent itemsets. In this paper, we devise a more general candidate set generation algorithm, LGen, which generates candidate itemsets of multiple sizes during each database scan. We present an algorithm FindLarge which uses \{LGen\} to find frequent itemsets. We show that, given a reasonable set of suggested frequent itemsets, FindLarge can significantly reduce the number of I/O passes required. In the best cases, only two passes are sufficient to discover all the frequent itemsets irrespective of the size of the biggest ones. Two I/O-saving algorithms, namely \{DIC\} and Pincher-Search, are compared with FindLarge in a series of experiments. We discuss the conditions under which FindLarge significantly outperforms the others in terms of I/O efficiency. }

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for classifying text documents into two disjoint classes. The new approach is based on extracting patterns, in the form of two logical expressions, which are defined on various features (indexing terms) of the documents. The pattern extraction is aimed at providing descriptions (in the form of two logical expressions) of the two classes of positive and negative examples. This is achieved by means of a data mining approach, called One Clause At a Time (OCAT), which is based on mathematical logic. The application of a logic-based approach to text document classification is critical when one wishes to be able to justify why a particular document has been assigned to one class versus the other class. This situation occurs, for instance, in declassifying documents that have been previously considered important to national security and thus are currently being kept as secret. Some computational experiments have investigated the effectiveness of the OCAT-based approach and compared it to the well-known vector space model (VSM). These tests also have investigated finding the best indexing terms that could be used in making these classification decisions. The results of these computational experiments on a sample of 2897 text documents from the \{TIPSTER\} collection indicate that the first approach has many advantages over the \{VSM\} approach for solving this type of text document classification problem. Moreover, a guided strategy for the OCAT-based approach is presented for deciding which document one needs to consider next while building the training example sets. }

Generalization from a syntactic parse tree as a measure of syntactic similarity is defined by the obtained set of maximum common sub-trees and is performed at the level of paragraphs, sentences, phrases and individual words. We analyze the semantic features of this similarity measure and compare it with the semantics of traditional anti-unification of terms. Nearest-Neighbor machine learning is then applied to relate the sentence to a semantic class. By using a syntactic parse tree-based similarity measure instead of the bag-of-words and keyword frequency approaches, we expect to detect a subtle difference between semantic classes that is otherwise unobservable. The proposed approach is evaluated in three distinct domains in which a lack of semantic information makes the classification of sentences rather difficult. We conclude that implicit indications of semantic classes can be extracted from syntactic structures. }

This paper introduces the first national census on pollution sources (target year 2007) in China, and describes \{NORM\} sites in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, one of the largest rare earth deposits in China. The ores are rich in radioactive elements, with a concentration of ThO2 of 0.01–0.05% and concentration of \{U3O8\} of 0.0005–0.002%. The large amount of \{NORM\} residues is regulated and controlled. After treatment of the waste water, it is discharged into tailing ponds and then pumped directly to milling plants for re-use. The waste gas after off-dust cleaning is discharged into the environment. A substantial amount of blast furnace iron slag from the waste treatment is transformed into cement, concrete, and bricks, or used directly for highway construction. This raises a serious environmental concern. As a result, environmental radiation monitoring and assessment have been introduced recently. Regulatory control of \{NORM\} is very important in order to take effective measures to lower the dose. }

Typically, we cannot generate new data sets on which to test hypotheses independently of the data that may have led to a particular theory. The common practice of using the same data set to formulate and test hypotheses introduces data-mining biases that, if not accounted for, invalidate the assumptions underlying classical statistical inference. A striking example of a data-driven discovery is the presence of calendar effects in stock returns. There appears to be very substantial evidence of systematic abnormal stock returns related to the day of the week, the week of the month, the month of the year, the turn of the month, holidays, and so forth. However, this evidence has largely been considered without accounting for the intensive search preceding it. In this paper we use 100 years of daily data and a new bootstrap procedure that allows us to explicitly measure the distortions in statistical inference induced by data mining. We find that although nominal p-values for individual calendar rules are extremely significant, once evaluated in the context of the full universe from which such rules were drawn, calendar effects no longer remain significant. }

With the continuing growth of the data volumes in many domains, the need of employing data mining techniques provides not only new opportunities but also immense challenges. In this article, we present our study on a challenging topic – integrating induction and deduction for noisy data mining. In particular, we assume the mechanism that corrupts the input data is a set of structured knowledge in the form of Associative Corruption (AC) rules. We apply deductive reasoning to generate the noise corruption rules; make error corrections on the input data with the help of these rules; and perform inductive learning from the corrected input data. Our experimental results show that the proposed integration framework is effective. }

We propose a method for discovering the dependency relationship between the topics of documents in adjacent time stamps based on the knowledge of content semantic similarity and social interactions of authors and repliers. We introduce mutual information measure to estimate the correlation between the topics. Applied to the realistic forum data, we show how topics are related and which postings can be recommended to another as similar topics. We also show how the authors impact the topics and propose a new way for evaluating author impact. }

The algorithm is implemented in two phases. First, we construct a U2P-tree that compresses the information in the target database. Then, we use the U2P-tree to discover frequent \{U2\} patterns. Potential frequent \{U2\} patterns are derived by combining base intervals and verified by traversing the U2P-tree. We also develop two techniques to speed up the mining process. Since the proposed method is based on a tree-traversing strategy, it is both efficient and scalable. Our experimental results demonstrate that the U2P-Miner algorithm outperforms three widely used algorithms, namely, the modified Apriori, modified H-mine, and modified depth-first backtracking algorithms. }

As people have many opportunities to express their opinions using various on-line channels (e.g., discussions, microblogs, social networks), the question is whether such data might be used for this purpose. Information hidden in the data includes the reasons why people perceive products or services as good or bad, what are the reasons of clients’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction, or what affects their sentiment. However, having the needed large amounts of data, it is hardly possible to process it manually. This paper presents a method that aims at automatic discovery of sources of human feelings hidden in textual messages that clients produce. For a demonstration, messages having a form of freely written reviews containing subjective evaluation of medical services were used. During analysis of the data, clusters representing groups of the whole reviews (or individual sentences) with a certain requested degree of similarity were created in an unsupervised manner. Then, a decision tree classifier was trained in order to find attributes (words) of the reviews that were significant for assigning the reviews to the clusters. Because individual words were sometimes not informative enough they were subsequently used as a starting point for searching for frequent multi-word expressions. As a result, the list of multi-word phrases representing frequent and important sources of clients’ opinions was presented. }

The mutual performance effects of parameters exhibit a prohibitively complex degree of interweaving, giving analytical performance investigations only relative relevance. Nevertheless, performance analysis is of utmost practical interest for the simulationist who wants to decide on the suitability of a certain \{DS\} protocol for a specific simulation model before substantial efforts are invested in developing sophisticated \{DS\} codes. Since \{DS\} performance prediction based on analytical models appears doubtful with respect to adequacy and accuracy, this work presents a prediction method based on the simulated execution of skeletal implementations of \{DS\} protocols. Performance data mining methods based on statistical analysis and a simulation tool for \{DS\} protocols have been developed for \{DS\} performance prediction, supporting the simulationist in three types of decision problems: (i) given a simulation problem and parallel execution platform, which \{DS\} protocol promises best performance, (ii) given a simulation model and a \{DS\} strategy, which execution platform is appropriate from the performance viewpoint, and (iii) what class of simulation models is best executed on a given multiprocessor using a certain \{DS\} protocol. Methodologically, skeletons of the most important variations of \{DS\} protocols are developed and executed in the N-MAP performance prediction environment. As a mining technique, performance data is collected and analyzed based on a full factorial design. The design predictor variables are used to explain \{DS\} performance. }

  abstract = {Researchers interests finding has been an active area of investigation for different recommendation tasks. Previous approaches for finding researchers interests exploit writing styles and links connectivity by considering time of documents, while semantics-based intrinsic structure of words is ignored. Consequently, a topic model named Author-Topic model is proposed, which exploits semantics-based intrinsic structure of words present between the authors of research papers. It ignores simultaneous modeling of time factor which results in exchangeability of topics problem, which is, important factor to deal with when finding dynamic research interests. For example, in many real world applications, like finding reviewers for papers and finding taggers in the social tagging systems one needs to consider different time periods. In this paper, we present time topic modeling approach named Temporal-Author-Topic (TAT) which can simultaneously model text, researchers and time of research papers to overcome the exchangeability of topic problem. The mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both co-occurrences of words and timestamps of the research papers. Consequently, topics occurrence and their related researchers change over time, while the meaning of particular topic almost remains unchanged. Proposed approach is used to discover topically related researchers for different time periods. We also show how their interests and relationships change over a time period. Empirical results on large research papers corpus show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and dominance over Author-Topic (AT) model, by handling the exchangeability of topics problem, which enables it to obtain similar meaning of a particular topic overtime. }

In this work, the model is built with the ultimate goal of predicting the level of the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong. The movement of Hang Seng Index, which is associated with other economics indices including the gross domestic product (GDP) index, the consumer price index (CPI), the interest rate, and the export value of goods from Hong Kong, is learnt by the proposed method. The case study shows that the proposed method is a feasible way to provide decision support for investors who may not be able to identify the hidden rules between the Hang Seng Index and other economics indices. }

The collected data far exceeds people's ability to analyze it. Thus, new and efficient methods are needed to discover knowledge from large spatial databases. Most of the spatial data mining methods do not take into account the uncertainty of spatial information. In our work we use objects with broad boundaries, the concept that absorbs all the uncertainty by which spatial data is commonly affected and allows computations in the presence of uncertainty without rough simplifications of the reality. The topological relations between objects with a broad boundary can be organized into a three-level concept hierarchy. We developed and implemented a method for an efficient determination of such topological relations. Based on the hierarchy of topological relations we present a method for mining spatial association rules for objects with uncertainty. The progressive refinement approach is used for the optimization of the mining process. }

The main goal is to seek useful knowledge for explaining failures in these processes. An overall method is developed to obtain association rules that represent the repeated relationships between pre-defined episodes in multiple time series, using a time window and a time lag. First, the process involves working in an iterative and interactive manner with several pre-processing and segmentation algorithms for each kind of time series in order to obtain significant events. In the next step, a search is made for sequences of events called episodes that are repeated among the various time series according to a pre-set consequent, a pre-established time window and a time lag. Extraction is then made of the association rules for those episodes that appear many times and have a high rate of hits. Finally, a case study is described regarding the application of this methodology to a historical database of 150 variables from an industrial process for galvanizing steel coils. }

Of the two feature selection methods — human judgement based on financial theory and \{ANOVA\} statistical method — we found the \{ANOVA\} method performs better than the human judgement method in all classifiers except discriminant analysis. Among the individual classifiers, decision trees and neural networks were found to provide better results. Finally, a hybrid method that combines the best features of several classification models is developed to increase the prediction performance. The empirical tests show that such a hybrid method produces higher prediction accuracy than individual classifiers. }

  abstract = {The amount of biomedical data in different disciplines is growing at an exponential rate. Integrating these significant knowledge sources to generate novel hypotheses for systems biology research is difficult. Compared to modern biomedical science, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complementary knowledge system and a completely different discipline. This chapter uses a significant \{TCM\} bibliographic literature database in China, together with MEDLINE, to help discover novel gene functional knowledge. We present an integrative mining approach to uncovering the functional gene relationships from \{MEDLINE\} and \{TCM\} bibliographic literature. This chapter introduces \{TCM\} literature (about 50,000 records) as one knowledge source for constructing literature-based gene networks. We use the \{TCM\} diagnosis and \{TCM\} syndrome to automatically congregate the related genes. The syndrome–gene relationships are discovered based on the syndrome–disease relationships extracted from \{TCM\} literature and the disease–gene relationships in MEDLINE. Based on the bubble-bootstrapping and relation weight computing methods, we have developed a prototype system called MeDisco/3S, which has name entity and relation extraction, and online analytical processing (OLAP) capabilities, to perform the integrative mining process. We have got about 200,000 syndrome–gene relations, which could help generate syndrome-based gene networks and help analyze the functional knowledge of genes from the syndrome perspective. We take the gene network of Kidney Yang Deficiency (KYD) syndrome and the functional analysis of some genes, such as \{CRH\} (corticotropin-releasing hormone), \{PTH\} (parathyroid hormone), \{PRL\} (prolactin), \{BRCA1\} (breast cancer 1, early onset), and \{BRCA2\} (breast cancer 2, early onset) to demonstrate the preliminary results. The underlying hypothesis is that the related genes of the same syndrome will have some biological functional relationships and will constitute a functional network. This chapter presents an approach to integrating \{TCM\} literature and modern biomedical data to discover novel gene networks and functional knowledge of genes. The preliminary results show that the novel gene functional knowledge and gene networks, which are worthy of further investigation, could be generated by integrating the two complementary biomedical data sources. It will be a promising research field through integrative mining of \{TCM\} and modern life science literature.

We present an application of \{D3M\} in Integrated Medicine, an interdisciplinary subject that explores and interprets the knowledge assets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by scientific methods in order to discover novel medical knowledge. We propose an ontology-based technical framework for hypothesis-driven Semantic Association Mining (SAM), which allows a knowledge network to emerge through the communication of Semantic Associations (SAs) by a multitude of agents in terms of hypotheses and evidence. Agents extract patterns from their own semantic graphs driven by the need to solve published hypotheses. Agents can publish discovered patterns as partial evidence that depends on some other hypotheses. We establish a multiagent environment to simulate the situation of the Semantic Web and evaluate the feasibility and scalability of hypothesis-driven \{SAM\} through multiagent collaboration. Through this mechanism, we utilize a shared domain ontology to synthesize complementary knowledge elements from both orthodox and traditional medicine, in order to support collaborative knowledge discovery and validation. The simulation shows that the framework can scale up to a large number of agents and ensure the quality of discovered SAs. We demonstrate a case study that discovers and integrates relationships and interactions centered on \{TCM\} herbs from distributed data sources. The resulting “HerbNet,” instead of a static dataset, is essentially an open and evolving knowledge network that is capable of answering complex domain problems and supporting hypothesis-driven knowledge discovery tasks.

The key challenge in supporting personalization is the need for rich metadata, such as metadata about structural relationships, subject/concept relations between documents and cognitive metadata about documents (e.g. difficulty of a document). Manual annotation of large knowledge bases with such rich metadata is not scalable. As well as, automatic mining of cognitive metadata is challenging since it is very difficult to understand underlying intellectual knowledge about document automatically. On the other hand, the Web content is increasing becoming multilingual since growing amount of data generated on the Web is non-English. Current metadata extraction systems are generally based on English content and this requires to be revolutionized in order to adapt to the changing dynamics of the Web. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel automatic metadata extraction framework, which is based on a novel fuzzy based method for automatic cognitive metadata generation and uses different document parsing algorithms to extract rich metadata from multilingual enterprise content using the newly developed DocBook, Resource Type and Topic ontologies. Since the metadata generation process is based upon DocBook structured enterprise content, our framework is focused on enterprise documents and content which is loosely based on the DocBook type of formatting. DocBook is a common documentation formatting to formally produce corporate data and it is adopted by many enterprises. The proposed framework is illustrated and evaluated on English, German and French versions of the Symantec Norton 360 knowledge bases. The user study showed that the proposed fuzzy-based method generates reasonably accurate values with an average precision of 89.39% on the metadata values of document difficulty, document interactivity level and document interactivity type. The proposed fuzzy inference system achieves improved results compared to a rule-based reasoner for difficulty metadata extraction (∼11% enhancement). In addition, user perceived metadata quality scores (mean of 5.57 out of 6) found to be high and automated metadata analysis showed that the extracted metadata is high quality and can be suitable for personalized information retrieval. }

  abstract = {Abstract An integrated approach is considered important for improving water management across a range of contexts – from water catchments to urban systems to mining sites. Challenges are faced in implementation due to the complexities in both human and physical (or engineered) dimensions. From a physical perspective, water systems are complex because issues are interconnected across spatial and temporal scales making it difficult to determine where to intervene to attain desired outcomes. The supporting human systems are also complex. Whether bounded at the company, regional or catchment scale, water systems are rarely controlled by a single actor or institution. For example, catchments extend across political boundaries, while different organisational departments share responsibilities for water reticulation through industrial sites. Effective water management requires coordinating decisions between diverse actors. This paper makes three contributions. First, from a consolidation of literature, three principles emerge that, if followed, should improve the management of a complex water system: (I) define whether the water issues to be addressed are simpler or more complex in nature; (II) discern whether the required response is more tactical or strategic; and (III) acknowledge the existence of boundaries and use them effectively. Second, a framework is proposed to support implementation of these principles using the mining industry as a test bed. The third contribution is an application at a case study site to examine the utility of the principles and the value of the framework. It is concluded that problems arising in a water system will be managed most effectively when problem complexity is “matched” with an equivalent management response. This practical approach may assist other industrial sites in comprehending the nature of the water issues affecting operations (simple to complex) and to assign the appropriate level of management authority relevant to the decision at hand (tactical to strategic). The framework may also have utility for managing water in a broader context, such as water catchments that lie across political boundaries. This may ultimately improve implementation of overarching concepts such as integrated water resources management (IWRM), assisting the recognised need to progress from theory to practice. }

As such aa favors features that constitute representative ‘corners’ of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that aa enjoys the interpretability of clustering – without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of svd – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale aa, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote FurthestSum that is inspired by the FurthestFirst approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the aa procedure to kernel-aa in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of aa when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the aa model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data. Matlab code for the derived algorithms is available for download from www.mortenmorup.dk. }

Typical algorithms for topic modeling include probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Despite their different inspirations, both approaches are instances of generative model, whereas the discriminative structure of the documents is ignored. In this paper, we propose locally discriminative topic model (LDTM), a novel topic modeling approach which considers both generative and discriminative structures of the data space. Different from \{PLSA\} and \{LDA\} in which the topic distribution of a document is dependent on all the other documents, \{LDTM\} takes a local perspective that the topic distribution of each document is strongly dependent on its neighbors. By modeling the local relationships of documents within each neighborhood via a local linear model, we learn topic distributions that vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold, and can better capture the discriminative structure in the data. The experimental results on text clustering and web page categorization demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. }

  abstract = {Flexibility is a term used in various fields with widely differing interpretations. Moreover, several related concepts, such as adaptability, exist that have an overlap in meaning or are simply used synonymously. This article presents a framing of flexibility, and three concepts with which it bears a close family resemblance, for the use in the context of infrastructure constellations. The definitions proposed in this frame draw inspiration from existing literature, though they are not based upon a classical literature review. Rather, a usable set of definitions is proposed for the intended context. The definitions all have the same structure to better appreciate how the concepts are related and how they differ. To verify whether the definitions correspond to their practical use, a data-mining exercise is performed on over 11,000 scientific articles that use the concepts of flexibility. After the corpus of articles is identified that is close to the intended field of application (infrastructure constellations), a co-occurrence analysis is carried out in order to clarify the differences between the concepts and to give nuance to the meaning conveyed in the definitions. }

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic topic model to infer regulatory networks of miRNAs and their target mRNAs for specific biological conditions at the post-transcriptional level, so-called functional miRNA–mRNA regulatory modules (FMRMs). The probabilistic model used in this paper can effectively capture the relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs in specific cellular conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method identifies negatively and positively correlated miRNA–mRNA pairs which are associated with epithelial, mesenchymal, and other condition in \{EMT\} (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) data set, respectively. Results on \{EMT\} data sets show that the inferred \{FMRMs\} can potentially construct the biological chain of ‘ miRNA → mRNA → condition ’ at the post-transcriptional level. }
