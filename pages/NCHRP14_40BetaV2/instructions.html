                    It is recommended that you save your inputs at this point using the green Save Button at the top of the page so as to avoid accidentally saving your changes to the template file.

            </ul>
            <li>
                Answer all questions in the Project Questionnaire section that have colored boxes for the answer.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please Note that questions 6 & 7 require 2 entries - the numeric value and appropriate units.

                <li>
                    If unsure how to answer the question, please click on the blue button to "Show Input Hints" at the top of the page.  These hints can be toggled on and off by clicking the button again.

                For each Core Mix to be used (up to 3), answer all questions that have colored boxes for the answer.

                <li>
                    Please Note that questions 2a-2e & 3a-3b require 2 entries - the numeric value and appropriate units & watch for any warning messages that may pop-up or be displayed in red to the right of the questions
                </li>
                <li>
                    The number of mixes to be used is entered under the Project Questionnaire section & should be discussed with the District Roadside Manager if you are unsure of the answer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When answering questions 2c or 2e about the steepest gradients, the default "units" are set to be entered as a slope ratio (i.e. 4:1 h:v), but only the first part of the ratio should be entered.  For example, to enter a 3:1 slope, type in just 3, and the program will automatically show 3.0:1.  Fractional slopes (such as 7:2) may be entered as a formula (=7/2) or a decimal (3.5) and will automatically be converted to a ":1" ratio.  Alternatively, the units can be changed to "Grade" and entered as a percentage (i.e. 40% or 0.4)
                </li>
                <li>
                    For any question in these sections that require direct entry of areas with units, an area calculator tool is provided in case you do not already know the size of the area in either square feet or acres.
                    It can be used for unit conversions (metric to imperial, yards or miles to feet, etc.)
                    or combining multiple sub-areas into one total area for each core mix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To use the area calculator tool, click on the button beside question 2a to open it and:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If sub areas are repeated (for example, 3 areas with the same length/width), they can be entered once by setting the multiplier at the bottom of the sub-area to the number of times the shape is repeated.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            Note: areas should be subdivided based on a break point of 3:1 slopes (33.33% grade) in order to assign the areas as Mow or Non-Mow correctly.
                        </li>

                Once all colored boxes in each section have been filled in, click the green "Show Results" button.

                Ensure that the Testing Laboratory selected & it's corresponding Test Method is correct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Answer the question about recommendations provided by the testing lab (below the Project Info section)<br>
                &emsp; └» If the answer is yes, enter the recommended application rate in tons/ac based on Agricultural Lime
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Note: if the rate provided was not in tons/acre, you can use excel to convert the rate.
                    The following conversion factors may be useful:<br>
                    1 acre = 43,560 square feet;  1 sq. yd. = 9 sq. ft.; 1 sq. mile = 27,878,400 sq. ft.<br>
                    1 sq. km = 100 hectares; 1 hectare = 107,639 sq. ft.;  1 sq. meter = 10.76 sq. ft.<br>
                    1 ton [US] = 2,000 lbs;  1 kg = 2.205 lbs;  1 metric ton = 2,204.6 lbs"<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>

                &emsp; └» For Groups B & C, select the % CCE that is closest to your specific product.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter the pH Buffer for each sample.  Please note that the pH range allowed by each test varies, and the program will only allow values within this range to be entered.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can skip this step if the answer from step #2 above is yes (the lab provided a Lime application rate recommendation either based on an average of all the samples analyzed, or the recommendations for each sample were the same)
