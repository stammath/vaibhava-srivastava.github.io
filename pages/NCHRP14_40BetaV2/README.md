# NCHRP-14-40

This is an interactive tool for NCHRP 14-40 under the supervision of Dr. Subasish Das. The website hosts an online roadside calculator adapted from VDOT that generates a PDF report of the results, making use of the jQuery, jsPDF and Bootstrap libraries. 

## Hosting

The website can be hosted through the file system or a local server. An internet connection is required for the libraries to be loaded from CDNs.
