2008,"Matthew Crisler, Johnell Brooks, Jennifer Ogle, Chris Guirl, Priyanka Alluri, Karen Dixon",Effect of Wireless Communication and Entertainment Devices on Simulated Driving Performance,"An analysis of the effect of wireless telephone communication using text and voice modalities as well as an Apple iPod on lane keeping, speed, speed variability, lateral speed, and lane position variability was conducted with a driving simulator. Participants (young adult licensed drivers) drove in an unusually curvy simulated driving environment while using wireless devices, controlling an iPod, and participating in conversations and word games. As expected on the basis of previous research, lane-keeping performance was robust for voice communication tasks; however, the text messaging and iPod tasks that required significant manual manipulation of the device resulted in significant decrements in lane-keeping performance. In addition, all wireless communication tasks and the iPod task resulted in significant increases in speed variability throughout the driving scenario. Lateral speed increases occurred for all wireless communication tasks other than the cellular phone conversation as well as the iPod task. Increases in lane position variability were observed for the text messaging conditions. In addition to establishing the dramatic performance decrement caused by text messaging tasks, this experiment suggests that driving performance may be affected by distraction in ways not captured by lane-keeping measures alone and explores potential alternative measures of driving performance that may be useful for identifying and quantifying the effects of distracted driving."
2014,"Karen Dixon, Lacy Brown"," Assessing How Drivers of Through Vehicles React to Driveway Activity","As population and development levels increase in both urban and rural areas, the implementation of access management strategies is vital for creating safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation systems. To meet the changing needs of transportation systems and their users, the accuracy and the applicability of the base assumptions used to develop access management guidelines must be verified. This research effort utilized a driving simulator study to investigate several assumptions related to driver behavior and access management. The simulator study focused on driver perception-reaction time in the vicinity of driveways and driver behavior in response to differing driveway activity types. The results indicated that the average and 85th percentile perception-reaction times for all drivers were 2.8 s and 4.3 s, respectively. Surprisingly, older drivers (age 65 and older) appeared to be more alert and had an 85th percentile perception-reaction time a full second shorter than that of their younger counterparts (3.3 s versus 4.4 s). The researchers also observed that deceleration rates had a curvilinear (not constant) relationship with vehicle speed, and these values were much lower than the accepted AASHTO value of 11.2 ft/s2. Finally, the predominant response to driveway activity was a slowing maneuver, not a stop or a lane change. This finding suggests that sight distance calculations based on an urgent stop may not be the most appropriate metric for determining access spacing guidelines for commercial urban road environments."
2009,"Karen Dixon, Michael Liebler, Michael Hunter","Urban Roadside SafetyCluster-Crash Evaluation","Roadside safety in rural environments has been the focus of considerable study, but direct application of this knowledge to the constrained urban environment has posed many challenges. Restricted right-of-way with a greater demand for functional use of the space adjacent to urban roads makes the maintenance of a wide clear zone impractical. This paper summarizes a corridor roadside crash analysis used to help identify urban roadside safety issues and illuminate possible solutions for attempting to mitigate objects in the roadside that have the potential to increase injury severity if hit. The paper focuses on arterial and collector-type facilities in urban areas with speed limits between 25 and 50 mph. The authors assessed corridors of urban roadside conditions and compared 6 years of historic crash data with roadside features. The goal of this effort was to identify potential configurations that posed a greater risk by the use of cluster-crash analysis. Locations with similar features without these companion crashes provided insight into prospective alternative treatments for roadside safety in urban environments. The higher-risk roadside locations identified by these approaches were referred to as urban control zones. The most commonly observed roadside crashes included locations in close lateral proximity to the curb face or lane edge, lane merge locations, select auxiliary lane treatments, sidewalk buffer configurations with rigid objects in close proximity to the travelway, driveway and intersection locations, high-cluster-crash locations, and other common roadside crash conditions."
,"Karen Dixon, Ida van Schalkwyk, Robert Layton",Balancing Urban Driveway Design Demands Based on Stopping Sight Distance,"Many roadways in urban areas, especially dense commercial areas, are subjected to on-street and adjacent off-street parking demands; local access through driveways is an essential component of these complex urban corridors. Vehicles entering and exiting these driveways_and their interaction with parked cars, other moving motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians_present challenges for a safe and efficient roadway corridor. The location and the design of these driveways, together with parking and bicycle facilities, generate sight distance challenges that affect pedestrians and bicyclists. This paper investigates the type and nature of impacts_including conflicts, sight distance, operations, and safety at driveway locations_as they relate to pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers. It also analyzes design geometrics that may help to provide adequate sight distance for safety at driveways with and without bicycle lanes present. Parked vehicles often obstruct drivers' view of approaching motor vehicles and bicycles. In many locations, vehicles exiting drive-ways must edge out into the active travel way for the driver to have an unobstructed view. Driveway location and design analysis demonstrate the value of bicycle lanes in providing enhanced sight distance. Current practices permit longitudinal placement of on-street parking too close to driveways. For safety reasons, agencies should consider excluding on-street parking on roads with bicycle lanes when speeds exceed 30 mph so as to provide adequate sight distance without creating sporadic on-street parking spacing. Roads without bicycle lanes often do not provide adequate stopping sight distance at on-street parking driveway locations when motor vehicle operating speeds exceed 25 mph."
1996,"Karen Dixon, Joseph Hummer, Ann Lorscheider",Capacity for North Carolina Freeway Work Zones,"Work zone capacity values for rural and urban freeways without continuous frontage roads were defined and determined. Data were collected using Nu-Metrics counters and classifiers at 24 work zones in North Carolina. The research included analysis of speed-flow behavior, evaluation of work zone sites based on lane configuration and site location, and determination of the location within the work zone where capacity is lowest. It was shown that the intensity of work activity and the type of study site (rural or urban) strongly affected work zone capacity. The data suggested that the location where capacity is reached is also variable based on the intensity of work. For heavy work in a two-lane to one-lane work zone configuration, the capacity values proposed at the active work area are approximately 1,200 vehicles per hour per lane for rural sites and 1,500 vehicles per hour per lane for urban sites. It is recommended that two distinct volumes be used when queue behavior in a freeway work zone is analyzed. The collapse from uninterrupted flow (designated work zone capacity) and the lower queue-discharge volume both should be considered."
1999,"Karen Dixon, Chi-Hung Wu, Wayne Sarasua, Janice Daniel",Estimating Free-Flow Speeds for Rural Multilane Highways,"The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 repealed the national maximum speed limit. As a result, many of the states have increased posted speed limits to 105 km/h (65 mph) for select multilane highways. This study evaluates the distribution of the speed and studies the influence of site characteristics, light conditions, and type of vehicle on the field-measured free-flow speed. The suitability of the Highway Capacity Manual multilane highway rules of thumb for freeflow speed to both an 89- and a 105-km/h (55- and 65-mph) posted speed limit condition is also discussed."
2012,"Raul Avelar, Karen Dixon","How Far from Optimal Are Current Advisory Speeds?Analysis Based on Safety Performance","expected performance of advisory speeds from the proposed procedure with the speeds derived from current posting guidelines. The comparable performance of the proposed procedure suggests that current guidelines are close to the hypothetically optimal advisory speed. In general, speeds determined by both the current and the new computational methods performed better than those determined by the ball bank indicator method. This paper also presents a field validation analysis of the engine function of the new posting method. The results confirmed the meaningfulness of the function and therefore the potential benefit of the proposed method for determining safety-based advisory speeds. The posting of advisory speed signs at sharp horizontal curves to provide the driving public with a safe speed is a practice well established in the United States. However, the operational effectiveness of these signs has long been questioned in the literature. The authors of this paper recently developed a function to model the expected safety effect of these signs. The function evolved from a statistical analysis of crash data from two-lane rural highways in the state of Oregon. In general, that initial research effort revealed that advisory speed signs tended to enhance safety. However, the results also suggested that advisory speed signs may not display the value with the greatest potential safety benefit. Because the function derived from that research proved meaningful from the engineering and human factors perspectives, the authors then extended the use of that function to compute and recommend the theoretically optimal advisory speed. A new posting procedure resulted from that effort. The authors compared the "
1998,"Mark Tarrall, Karen Dixon",Conflict Analysis for Double Left-Turn Lanes with Protected-Plus-Permitted Signal Phases,A conflict study evaluated double left-turn lanes with protected-plus-permitted signal phasing. The data collection team observed traffic behavior at four intersections in the metro Atlanta region. Included in the data set are three intersections operating under protected-plus-permitted signal phasing and a fourth intersection with a before and after examination of a protected-plus-permitted signal phase changed to protected-only phasing. The authors calculated the traffic rates for five conflict types and one traffic event unique to double left-turn movements. A statistically significant decrease in traffic conflicts was identified for the before and after comparison site. The study also identifies unique intersection geometry and traffic volumes at each site and compares traffic conflicts associated with the features. The results generally show that the enhanced capacity of double left-turn lane intersections operating under protected-plus-permitted signal phasing may occur at the expense of the safety of the traveling public.
2000,"Govindarajan Vadakpat, Shelley Stoffels, Karen Dixon",Road User Cost Models for Network-Level Pavement Management,"Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of pavements is a process for evaluating total economic worth of a usable project segment by analyzing initial costs and discounted future costs, such as those for maintenance, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and resurfacing. One of the most important ingredients in the LCCA process, at either a network level or a project level, is the determination of road user cost (RUC) during maintenance and rehabilitation operations. RUC models are also important in contracting strategies, which take into account time for a project to be completed for award and payment. Methods used to date to determine RUC are exclusively analytical in nature. Microscopic estimates of traffic are used to determine RUC. CORSIM, a microscopic traffic simulation program developed by FHWA, was used for this research. Models for additional travel time, added fuel consumption, and RUC for standard two-to-one lane closure scenarios are presented."
2000,"Janice Daniel, Karen Dixon, David Jared",Analysis of Fatal Crashes in Georgia Work Zones,"Studies on work zone crashes typically examine a combination of injury, fatal, and property damage crashes to identify factors that contribute to unsafe conditions within work zones. Few studies focus on fatal crashes within work zones, although a clear understanding of the driver, roadway, and work zone conditions associated with fatal crashes will facilitate the development of strategies aimed at improving safety and reducing fatal as well as nonfatal crashes. The Georgia Department of Transportation recently performed a study to identify the manner of collision, location, and construction activity associated with fatal crashes in work zones. This study is expanded further to examine the difference between fatal crash activity within work zones compared with fatal crashes in non-work-zone locations. Using data from three work zone locations in Georgia, fatal crash activity within work zones also was compared with nonfatal crashes within work zones. Finally, fatal crash activity was examined to determine the influence of the work zone activity on the frequency of fatal crashes. The overall findings of the study indicate that the work zone influences the manner of collision, light conditions, truck involvement, and roadway functional classification under which fatal crashes occur. The study also indicates that fatal crashes in work zones are more likely to involve another vehicle than non-work-zone fatal crashes, and fatal crashes in work zones are less influenced by horizontal and vertical alignment than are non-work-zone crashes."
2003,"Chunyan Wang, Karen Dixon, David Jared",Evaluating Speed-Reduction Strategies for Highway Work Zones,"Research was conducted to identify the potential of fluorescent orange sheeting, innovative message signs, and changeable message signs with radar for reducing speeds in highway work zones. The study investigated the effect of each strategy immediately after implementation (immediate effect) as well as several weeks after implementation (novelty effect). In addition to the overall effect of each strategy on all vehicles, the study included the effect on specific vehicle types during various lighting conditions. The researchers collected traffic data before, immediately after, and 2 or 3 weeks after implementation of each strategy (3 consecutive weeks for the changeable message sign). They collected data upstream of the temporary traffic-control zone, in the advancewarning area, and adjacent to the active work area. The researchers used various statistical tests to evaluate the significance of speed changes from phase to phase and adjusted vehicle speeds with the upstream speed changes over time. The study indicated that fluorescent orange sheeting and innovative message signs help reduce speeds at highway work zones (with diminished influence over time). Moreover, both strategies influence vehicle speeds more during the day than at night. Drivers of passenger vehicles tended to decrease their speeds more than did truck drivers. Changeable message signs with radar significantly reduced the vehicle speeds in the immediate vicinity of the sign and did not demonstrate a novelty effect."
2005,"Jun Wang, Karen Dixon, Hainan Li, Jennifer Ogle",Normal Deceleration Behavior of Passenger Vehicles at Stop Sign-Controlled Intersections Evaluated with In-Vehicle Global Positioning System Data,"Deceleration characteristics of passenger cars are often used in traffic simulation, vehicle fuel consumption and emissions models, and intersection and deceleration-lane design. Most previous studies collected spot speed data with detectors or radar guns. Because of the limitations of the data collection methods, these studies could not determine when and where drivers began to decelerate. Therefore, the studies may not provide an accurate estimation of deceleration time and distance. Furthermore, most previous studies are based on outdated and limited data, and their conclusions may not be applicable to the current vehicle fleet and drivers. The normal deceleration behavior of current passenger vehicles is evaluated at stop sign-controlled intersections on urban streets on the basis of in-vehicle Global Positioning System data. This study determined that drivers with higher approach speeds decelerated over a longer time and distance. Higher initial deceleration rates were also associated with higher approach speeds. However, the collected data in this study did not indicate a clear relationship between the average and maximum deceleration rates and approach speeds. With second-by-second deceleration profile data, the authors found that most drivers reached their maximum deceleration rates about 5 s or less than 5 s before stopping, and the maximum deceleration rate (3.4 m/s2) recommended by AASHTO was applicable to most of the study drivers. This review verified several previous deceleration models with the current observations and found that the polynomial model developed by Akcelik and Biggs provides the best fit for the data set in this study. Finally, this study developed a new deceleration model based on the approach speeds and deceleration time."
2004,"Jun Wang, Karen Dixon, Hainan Li, Jennifer Ogle",Normal Acceleration Behavior of Passenger Vehicles Starting from Rest at All-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections,"Acceleration characteristics of passenger cars starting from rest are often used in traffic simulation, modeling of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions, and design of intersections, acceleration lanes for entrance terminals, turning bays, and passing lanes. Most of the previous studies developed four different acceleration models: the constant acceleration model, the two-phase model, the linear-decreasing acceleration model, and the polynomial acceleration model. However, most of the studies were based on outdated and limited data, so their conclusions may not be applicable for the current vehicle fleet and drivers. The normal acceleration behavior of current passenger vehicles starting from rest at all-way stop-controlled intersections is evaluated, and the previous acceleration models are verified with recent observations. A comparison is included between the acceleration behaviors of straight and turning maneuvers and the influence of speed limits on acceleration rates, and two new polynomial models are developed for driver acceleration behavior for turning maneuvers versus straight maneuver acceleration from a stopped condition."
2010,"Saroch Boonsiripant, Michael Hunter, Karen Dixon, Michael Rodgers",Measurement and Comparison of Acceleration and Deceleration Zones at Traffic Control Intersections,"Acceleration and deceleration characteristics are basic driving behaviors that influence signal control and road geometry. Most previous studies focused on acceleration and deceleration rates under ideal conditions, i.e., on characteristics of lead vehicles, which might not adequately reflect the full spectrum of traffic operations. This paper presents a methodology for determining acceleration and deceleration rates and zone lengths for vehicles approaching and leaving intersections under likely uncongested traffic conditions, regardless of queue position. These characteristics are derived from speed profiles gained from vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) instrumentation. With the speed profiles obtained from GPS-equipped vehicles, a series of data-processing algorithms is developed to measure the acceleration and deceleration behavior of vehicles approaching and departing an intersection. Acceleration and deceleration rates and zone lengths are estimated for several road categories. These zone lengths are compared with recommended values from AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (Green Book), in which it is seen that the zone lengths under light traffic conditions are longer than the Green Book's values. In addition, determined acceleration and deceleration rates and zone lengths are found to depend on the underlying assumptions and calculation methods of the analysis."
2011,"Fei Xie, Kristie Gladhill, Karen Dixon, Christopher Monsere",Calibration of Highway Safety Manual Predictive Models for Oregon State Highways,"The recently released Highway Safety Manual (HSM) published by AASHTO provides a comprehensive set of tools for evaluating and identifying opportunities to improve safety for highway facilities. Included in the HSM is a quantitative method for predicting crashes on the basis of recently developed scientific approaches. These predictive methods currently exist for three facility types: rural two-lane roads; rural multilane highways; and urban and suburban arterial highways. To enhance precision, each HSM predictive method should be calibrated for location conditions. This paper demonstrates the HSM calibration procedure for total crashes in Oregon. The research identified three critical data collection limitations on information about pedestrian volumes, minor road traffic volumes at rural locations, and minimum sample size for underrepresented crash locations. Most of the calibration factors for Oregon were determined to be considerably lower than the expected value of approximately 1, and this observation was attributed to Oregon crash reporting thresholds and procedures. The paper includes an evaluation of crash severity distribution methods and an assessment of the significance of collision type distributions on the overall predicted crashes."
2006,"Jun Wang, Karen Dixon, Hainan Li, Michael Hunter",Operating-Speed Model for Low-Speed Urban Tangent Streets Based on In-Vehicle Global Positioning System Data,"Low-speed urban streets are designed to provide both access and mobility and to accommodate multiple road users, such as bicyclists and pedestrians. However, speeds on these facilities often exceed the intended operating speeds, as well as their design speeds. Several studies have indicated that the design speed concept, as implemented in the roadway design process in the United States, does not guarantee a consistent alignment promoting uniform operating speeds less than design speeds. A promising design approach to overcome these apparent shortfalls of the design speed approach is a performance-based design procedure with the incorporation of operating speeds. However, this approach requires a clear understanding of the relationships between operating speeds and various road environments. Although numerous previous studies have developed operating-speed models, most of these studies have concentrated on high-speed, rural two-lane highways. In contrast, highway designers and planners have little information about the influence of low-speed urban street environments on drivers' speeds. This study investigated the relationship between drivers' speed choices and their associated low-speed urban roadway environments by analyzing second-by-second in-vehicle global positioning system (GPS) data from more than 200 randomly selected vehicles in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. The authors developed operating-speed models for low-speed urban street segments on the bases of roadway alignment, cross-section characteristics, roadside features, and adjacent land uses. The results of this research effort can help highway designers and planners better understand expected operating speeds when they design and evaluate low-speed urban roadways."
2004,"Randall Guensler, Karen Dixon, Vetri Elango, Seungju Yoon",MOBILE Matrix: Application of Georgia Statewide Multimodal Transportation Planning Tool for Rural Areas,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's MOBILE emission rate model is used to evaluate carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter impacts of major transportation projects. Using fleet characteristics, environmental conditions, and on-road operating conditions, MOBILE estimates fleet average emission rates. Coupling projected traffic volumes and physical roadway characteristics yields pollutant mass flux rates with which dispersion models predict downwind pollutant concentrations. Distance-flux relationships may also prove useful in pollutant exposure modeling to help quantify relative environmental risks of living or working near major roadways. Applying the MOBILE model requires the creation and execution of scenario-specific input files, which must be properly structured. Researchers developed the MOBILE-matrix model to facilitate more readily the use of MOBILE emission rates in transportation modeling. The matrix creates large emission rate lookup tables that can be applied to traffic in any facility or subregion. It performs all necessary model runs well before a future modeling need. The goal of this specific application is to integrate MOBILE-matrix capabilities into the multimodal transportation planning tool (MTPT) employed by the Georgia Department of Transportation so that it can be used to estimate emissions from rural road facilities throughout the state. Thousands of MOBILE6.2 runs were executed to generate database output files, which were post-processed to create MOBILE-matrix lookup tables for 159 Georgia counties. For each transportation link in the MTPT, emission rates are extracted from the lookup matrix by facility type, average speed, temperature, and so forth. The predicted emissions can then be used for a variety of transportation planning purposes."
2010,"Hong Zhu, Karen Dixon, Simon Washington, David Jared",Predicting Single-Vehicle Fatal Crashes for Two-Lane Rural Highways in Southeastern United States,"The rural two-lane highway in the southeastern United States is frequently associated with a disproportionate number of serious and fatal crashes and as such remains a focus of considerable safety research. The Georgia Department of Transportation spearheaded a regional fatal crash analysis to identify various safety performances of two-lane rural highways and to offer guidance for identifying suitable countermeasures with which to mitigate fatal crashes. The fatal crash data used in this study were compiled from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The database, developed for an earlier study, included 557 randomly selected fatal crashes from 1997 or 1998 or both (this varied by state). Each participating state identified the candidate crashes and performed physical or video site visits to construct crash databases with enhance site-specific information. Motivated by the hypothesis that single- and multiple-vehicle crashes arise from fundamentally different circumstances, the research team applied binary logit models to predict the probability that a fatal crash is a single-vehicle run-off-road fatal crash given roadway design characteristics, roadside environment features, and traffic conditions proximal to the crash site. A wide variety of factors appears to influence or be associated with single-vehicle fatal crashes. In a model transferability assessment, the authors determined that lane width, horizontal curvature, and ambient lighting are the only three significant variables that are consistent for single-vehicle run-off-road crashes for all study locations."
2013,"Raul Avelar, Karen Dixon, Lacy Brown, Megan Mecham, Ida van Schalkwyk",Influence of Land Use and Driveway Placement on Safety Performance of Arterial Highways,"Characterizing driveway safety is a relevant and relatively complex topic in transportation safety research. This research studied the safety link of driveways abutting Oregon highways and considered various factors proposed in the current literature for design and evaluation of the safety performance of roadside elements. On the basis of two probability samples from rural and urban arterial state highways, this research developed alternative safety performance functions to evaluate the safety impacts of various driveway configurations. These safety performance functions were intended to explore driveway safety beyond the average driveway density treatment commonly encountered in the literature. The statistical models and methodologies in this research are comparable with those in the Highway Safety Manual. The proposed models exhibited different ranges of effects for urban and rural conditions, but type of land use proved a prominent factor for both the urban and the rural models. The analysis showed that roadside safety is influenced mainly by driveways associated with commercial and industrial land uses in the urban environment. Similarly, industrial driveways are more influential for safety than other types in rural environments. In addition, the rural model uncovered a safety connection to clusters of driveways rather than to driveways alone. This research indicated that after driveway land use in rural environments was accounted for, clustered driveways tended to have fewer crashes compared with isolated driveways."
2011,"Daniel Melcher, Karen Dixon, Simon Washington, Chi-Hung Wu","Feasibility of ""Subjective"" Engineering Assessments of Road Safety Improvements: Bayesian Analysis Development","Regional safety program managers face a daunting challenge in the attempt to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses that result from motor vehicle crashes. This difficult mission is complicated by the combination of a large perceived need, small budget, and uncertainty about how effective each proposed countermeasure would be if implemented. A manager can turn to the research record for insight, but the measured effect of a single countermeasure often varies widely from study to study and across jurisdictions. The challenge of converting widespread and conflicting research results into a regionally meaningful conclusion can be addressed by incorporating ""subjective"" information into a Bayesian analysis framework. Engineering evaluations of crashes provide the subjective input on countermeasure effectiveness in the proposed Bayesian analysis framework. Empirical Bayes approaches are widely used in before-and-after studies and ""hot-spot"" identification; however, in these cases, the prior information was typically obtained from the data (empirically), not subjective sources. The power and advantages of Bayesian methods for assessing countermeasure effectiveness are presented. Also, an engineering evaluation approach developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology is described. Results are presented from an experiment conducted to assess the repeatability and objectivity of subjective engineering evaluations. In particular, the focus is on the importance, methodology, and feasibility of the subjective engineering evaluation for assessing countermeasures."
1997,"Robert Awuah-Baffour, Wayne Sarasua, Karen Dixon, William Bachman, Randall Guensler",Global Positioning System with an Attitude: Method for Collecting Roadway Grade and Superelevation Data,"The use of a specialized Global Positioning System (GPS) to conduct high-speed surveys of roadway alignment, grade, and cross-slope characteristics is discussed. The system uses a single GPS receiver that has 24 channels monitoring four separate antennas (six channels each). The collection of attitude (heading, pitch, and roll) is made possible through the relative orientation of the antennas. By mounting the system on a road surveillance vehicle, accurate grades, superelevation, and crown measurements can be made without differentially correcting the GPS data. However, to gather precise positional data that correspond to the roadway measurements, differential correction with a GPS base station at a fixed known point is required. The design and use of this attitude GPS unit are addressed. Accuracy specifications for static testing are provided along with techniques to maximize this accuracy. Kinematic data collection is depicted for a local road and a freeway off-ramp. The use of digital terrain modeling technology provides a promising graphic database representation of the roadway characteristics."
