                - Four types of before-after studies: (1) simple (Naïve) before-and-after analysis, (2) comparison group (CG) analysis, (3) empirical Bayes (EB) analysis and (4) full Bayes (FB) analysis. The EB Method for estimating safety increases the precision of estimation to address the limitation of the Naïve and CG Methods. This method is based on the recognition that  <font color="#00A08A">crash counts are not the only measure of safety for an entity.</font> To estimate the expected number of crashes in the treatment site without treatment, the EB Method considers two trends: (1) the crash trend at the treatment site prior to the treatment installation, and (2) the safety performance or crash trends at similar sites, referred as comparison sites that did not have any treatment during the analysis period. The FB analysis is a useful before-and-after method because it better accounts for uncertainty in data used, however, is a complex alternative to the EB approach. Thus unattractive.
