                <blockquote>Edge lines on rural highways. A series of research and implementation studies in Louisiana showed that placing edge lines on rural two-lane highways improves how drivers position their vehicles in the lane and reduces crashes by more than 15 percent. The state calculates an impressive benefit–cost ratio of 19:1.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Research sponsored by the Louisiana Transportation Research Center resulted in the development of a Louisiana-specific crash modification factor (CMF) for converting a four-lane urban undivided roadway to a five-lane roadway by re-striping. In the last decade, Louisiana DOTD converted several segments of urban undivided four-lane roadways to five-lane roadways with a center two-way left turn lane by re-striping pavement markings without increasing pavement width. Based on a statistical analysis with six years of crash data, the CMF for all of those segments is estimated to be less than 0.6 with a standard deviation less than 0.07.</blockquote>

                <p><font size="4" color="Green">2015 Eno Fellowship: </font>Each summer, the Eno Future Leader Development Conference brings a select group of the top graduate students in transportation and related disciplines to the nation’s capital for an introduction to how transportation policy and programs are formed. During their week in Washington, the “Eno Fellows” meet with leaders from key transportation constituencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation and its modal administrations, congressional committees, industry associations, and numerous advocacy groups. The Fellows also tour the local transportation facilities, discuss career planning with the Eno Board of Directors, and get to know one another in informal settings. At the end of the week, they are welcomed into the Eno Alumni Network that includes hundreds of transportation leaders representing all modes and areas of the country. The Network offers valuable resources for continuing education, involvement in policy issues, and career development. <em>Subasish Das</em> was selected as one out of twenty 2015 Eno Fellows. The overall value of the award is $5,000.</p>
