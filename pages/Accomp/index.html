During their week in Washington, the “Eno Fellows” meet with leaders from key transportation constituencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation and its modal administrations, congressional committees, industry associations, and numerous advocacy groups. The Fellows also tour the local transportation facilities, discuss career planning with the Eno Board of Directors, and get to know one another in informal settings. At the end of the week, they are welcomed into the Eno Alumni Network that includes hundreds of transportation leaders representing all modes and areas of the country. The Network offers valuable resources for continuing education, involvement in policy issues, and career development. <em>Subasish Das</em> was selected as one out of twenty 2015 Eno Fellows</a>. The overall value of the award is $5,000.</p>
