                 <li>- Attached are two documents. The first is the statement on pedestrain risk exposures that I would like you to read and hear your comments on. There is actually a 400 word limit and it is currently around 650, so if you could find any way to remove a few words that would be great. Also attached is another statement on risk exposures of holiday drinking.</li>
                <li>- Attached is the spreadsheet. Can you please update the crash counts (upto 2014) on the attached file?</li>
                <li>- Attached is the first draft of the CMF report to be presented at the meeting on December 10. It is 85 pages long, single line spacing.</li>

                <li>- Attached is the word document on the data wrangling procedure that I currently use to extract the data from access database.</li>
                <p>- Attached is the first draft of the presentation – if you could just quickly look through it and give me your thoughts.</p>
                <p>- Please find attached the spreadsheet on pedestrain crashes in Louisiana. The spreadsheet contains:
                    <Blockquote><li>Monthy fatal crashes in all parishes.</li>
                    <li>Data merging VBA.</li>

                 <li>- I am sending you a Word version of the draft, so that you can make the changes directly using Track Changes – please don’t use the Comments function in Word.</li>
                 <li>- Could you possibly spare a few minutes to go through the draft version of the report and send us your comments? Your cooperation is very much appreciated.</li>
                 <li>- Your presentation is pretty impressive, well done. Here are just a few comments which you are welcome to ignore.</li>
                 <li>- Hope you find these comments useful, and bear in mind that I’ve only focused on what changes I believe need making so I’m sorry if it comes across as being very critical.</li>
                 <li>- Please let me have your comments on my presentation slides, suggestions for improvements in places and anything you think might be useful.</li>
                 <li>- I have now had a chance to look at your report, it looks very good. I was really impressed with your report. The only comments I have to make are in the section "Conclusions". </li>

            <font size="3"> 
                <li>- I don’t know if you are the right person to ask but I need the information about the source file of the D3.js in the company website.</li>
                <li>- If you are not the right contact, please could you let me know who I should contact.</li>
                <li>- If there is someone who is more suitable for me to contact, maybe you could forward this email to them.</li>
                <li>- I know that this is not your specific field but I was hoping you might be able to put me in contact with the right person.</li>
