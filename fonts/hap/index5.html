            <font size="3"> 
                 <li>- Attached are two documents. The first is the statement on pedestrain risk exposures that I would like you to read and hear your comments on. There is actually a 400 word limit and it is currently around 650, so if you could find any way to remove a few words that would be great. Also attached is another statement on risk exposures of holiday drinking.</li>
                <li>- Attached is the spreadsheet. Can you please update the crash counts (upto 2014) on the attached file?</li>
                <li>- Attached is the first draft of the CMF report to be presented at the meeting on December 10. It is 85 pages long, single line spacing.</li>

                <li>- Attached is the word document on the data wrangling procedure that I currently use to extract the data from access database.</li>
                <p>- Attached is the first draft of the presentation – if you could just quickly look through it and give me your thoughts.</p>
                <p>- Please find attached the spreadsheet on pedestrain crashes in Louisiana. The spreadsheet contains:
                    <Blockquote><li>Monthy fatal crashes in all parishes.</li>
                    <li>Data merging VBA.</li>

            <font size="3"> 
                 <li>- I am sending you a Word version of the draft, so that you can make the changes directly using Track Changes – please don’t use the Comments function in Word.</li>
                 <li>- Could you possibly spare a few minutes to go through the draft version of the report and send us your comments? Your cooperation is very much appreciated.</li>
                 <li>- Your presentation is pretty impressive, well done. Here are just a few comments which you are welcome to ignore.</li>
                 <li>- Hope you find these comments useful, and bear in mind that I’ve only focused on what changes I believe need making so I’m sorry if it comes across as being very critical.</li>
                 <li>- Please let me have your comments on my presentation slides, suggestions for improvements in places and anything you think might be useful.</li>
                 <li>- I have now had a chance to look at your report, it looks very good. I was really impressed with your report. The only comments I have to make are in the section "Conclusions". </li>

            <font size="3"> 
                <li>- I don’t know if you are the right person to ask but I need the information about the source file of the D3.js in the company website.</li>
                <li>- If you are not the right contact, please could you let me know who I should contact.</li>
                <li>- If there is someone who is more suitable for me to contact, maybe you could forward this email to them.</li>
                <li>- I know that this is not your specific field but I was hoping you might be able to put me in contact with the right person.</li>

            <font size="3"> 
                <li>- Sorry to ask again but any initial feedback on my intial draft. We are very anxious to hear any news.</li>
                <li>- I am very much aware that you have a huge workload and I certainly don’t want to waste any of your valuable time but I am sure you will appreciate that I need to get your feedback on my initial draft by the end of this month. </li>
                <li>- I was wondering whether you had had a chance to look at the email I sent you dated 10 January (see below).</li>

                <li>- I know this is asking a lot, but I really need an answer by 15.00 London time tomorrow.</li>
                <li>- I am rather concerned about the situation with the sales presentation, as I urgently need to start going through what you have done on it. If you still need time to work on it, then we need to find a solution together. In any case, I would be grateful if could you get back to me in the next 2–3 hours.</li>


                <li>- I apologize for having to ask you this, but I am sure you can appreciate my situation. Thank you.</li

            <font size="3"> 
                <li>- I think you must have sent me the wrong attachment.</li>
                <li>- Could you send your fax number again as I think I must have the wrong number.</li>
                <li>- By the way I found a mistake in one your personal blog, under ‘Research Projects’ I think it should say ‘edge line’ rather than ‘edg line’.</li>
